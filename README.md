# wiki stub expansion

A data science project which models the popularity of Wikipedia pages based on page attributes. Examples of these attributes are: number of links in an page, number of words in a page, and the number of edits a page has received.

Initial analysis has idenfied that the number of links external websites, the number of wikipedia pages that point to the website in question, and the number of wikifiles that are linked to by a page are strongly correlated with increased number of page views.
