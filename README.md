# wiki stub expansion

A data science project which models the popularity of Wikipedia pages based on page attributes. Examples of these attributes are: number of links in an page, number of words in a page, and the number of edits a page has received. I am pursuing this project because I’ve been fascinated with Wikipedia since I discovered it 15 years ago. Thus far, I’ve written data collection scripts, metadata processing scripts, data cleaning scripts, and have started my analysis. Preliminary analysis on ~8000 wikipedia pages has identified that the length of a page and the number of pages that contain links that point to it positively correlate with its popularity. However, I have not yet been able to show that increases in these metrics directly result increased popularity.
