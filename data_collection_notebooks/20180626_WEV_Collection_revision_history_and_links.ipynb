However, by replacing the URL <tt>\\'\\'\\'http\\'\\'\\'://mail.google.com/mail/</tt> with <tt>\\'\\'\\'https\\'\\'\\'://mail.google.com/mail/</tt>, users were able to force Gmail to use a secure connection, reducing the risk of third-party eavesdropping on user information, such as emails and contacts, which are transmitted in plaintext as JavaScript data in the page source code. Starting in July 2008, it was possible to configure Gmail for HTTPS access only through the Settings - this prevented any insecure access via HTTP. POP3 and IMAP access uses [[Transport Layer Security]], or TLS. At present Gmail now defaults to a secure HTTPS connection.\\n\\nAlthough email clients such as [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] use TLS when sending email, it is not used when the email is sent from the Gmail servers to the destination domain\\'s [[Mail transfer agent|mail exchangers]], unless supported, so at some stage the user\\'s email message may still be transmitted in unencrypted plain text.\\n\\nOn March 20, 2014, Google announced the implementation of an enhancement of the overall security of Gmail in response to the [[Edward Snowden]] privacy revelations in 2013. An encrypted HTTPS connection will be used for the sending and receipt of all Gmail emails, and \"every single email message you send or receive—100% of them—is encrypted while moving internally\" through the corporation\\'s systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Now Gmail Encrypts Messages Sent to Google Servers|url=http://mashable.com/2014/03/20/gmail-https-only/|work=Mashable|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=21 March 2014|author=Christina Warren|date=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Staying at the forefront of email security and reliability: HTTPS-only and 99.978% availability|url=http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/03/staying-at-forefront-of-email-security.html|work=Official Gmail Blog|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=21 March 2014|author=Nicolas Lidzborski|date=20 March 2014}}</ref>\\n\\nAround 2007, Gmail had severe security issues which allowed a full account compromise via [[Cross-site scripting]] vulnerabilities affecting the google.com homepage or information disclosure through a file which was stored on Google\\'s server and included all the Email contacts of the currently logged in user.

Users can disable the spam-filtering system by creating a rule to make all messages skip the spam filter. POP3 users can only check the Spam folder manually via the web interface, as only emails sent to the Inbox can be retrieved via POP3. This is a technical limitation of POP3. In 2008, about 75% of email sent to Gmail accounts was filtered as spam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7441132.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Technology - Google\\'s experimental Gmail toys|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\\n\\nIP addresses of webmail Gmail users are disguised in order to protect security, an early decision by Paul Buchheit.<ref>[https://support.google.com/mail/answer/26903?hl=en Seeing a sender\\'s IP address] Gmail Help (accessed September 20, 2014)</ref><ref>Mike Hearn: [https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/messaging/2014/000780.html &#91;messaging&#93; Modern anti-spam and E2E crypto].

[[Yahoo! Mail]] went from 4 MB to 100 MB and 2 GB for Yahoo! Mail Plus accounts. Yahoo! Mail storage then increased to 250 MB and in late April 2005 to 1 GB. \\nYahoo!

The desire to catch up was especially noted in the case of MSN\\'s Hotmail, which upgraded its email storage from 250 MB to the new Windows Live Hotmail which includes 5 GB of storage that expands if necessary.

Privacy advocates raised concerns that the plan involved scanning their personal, private emails and that this was a security problem. Allowing email content to be read, even by a computer, raises the risk that the [[expectation of privacy]] in email will be reduced. Furthermore, email that non-subscribers choose to send to Gmail accounts is scanned by Gmail as well, even though those senders never agreed to Gmail\\'s terms of service or [[privacy policy]].\\nGoogle can change its privacy policy unilaterally and Google is technically able to cross-reference cookies across its information-rich product line to make dossiers on individuals. \\nHowever, most email systems make use of server-side content scanning in order to check for [[E-mail spam|spam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epic.org/privacy/gmail/faq.html|title=Gmail Privacy Page|accessdate=2008-06-01|date=2004-07-18|publisher=Electronic Privacy Information Center}}</ref><ref name=\"Register15Jun04\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/15/gmail_spook_heaven/| title = Google\\'s Gmail: spook heaven?|accessdate = 2008-11-24|last = Rasch|first = Mark|authorlink = |date=June 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2010/01/goog_v_china_hi.php |title=GOOG v China Highlights Security Risk Of Wiretapping Systems — SVW |publisher=Siliconvalleywatcher.com |accessdate=2011-08-12}}</ref>\\n\\nGoogle defends its position by citing its use of email-scanning to the user\\'s benefit.

Google has the ability to combine information contained in a person\\'s email messages with information from Internet searches, but had not confirmed how long such information is kept or how it can be used. One of the concerns was that it could be of interest to law enforcement agencies.

For example, if a user sends a query to a large group of people, all of the responses are stored in a single conversation that is impossible to break apart. There is no way to search for responses from one user without getting the entire conversation. \\nWhile deletion of individual emails is possible, most operations, such as archiving and labeling, can be performed only on whole conversations. Conversations cannot be split up or combined.\\nAs a result of complaints from some users, Google made conversation view optional starting September 29, 2010.  The change was only made for the web app.  The mobile app do not offer any option for disabling conversation view. There is currently no method to split individual conversations in any Gmail app.\\n\\nGmail user names are period insensitive for e-mail purposes. example@gmail.com is the same e-mail address as ex.ample@gmail.com.

The current C++14 standard supersedes these and [[C++11]], with [[C++14|new features]] and an enlarged [[#Standard library|standard library]].  Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] at [[Bell Labs]] since 1979, as an extension of the [[C (programming language)|C language]] as he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C, which also provided high-level features for program organization.\\n\\nMany other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and newer versions of C (after 1998).\\n\\n== History ==\\n[[File:BjarneStroustrup.jpg|thumb|[[Bjarne Stroustrup]], the creator of C++]]\\n\\n[[Bjarne Stroustrup]], a Danish computer scientist, began his work on C++\\'s predecessor \"{{visible anchor|C with [[Class (computer programming)|Classes]]}}\" in 1979.<ref name=\"invention3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#invention|title = Bjarne Stroustrup\\'s FAQ: When was C++ invented?|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|website = stroustrup.com|date = 7 March 2010|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}\\n</ref> The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup\\'s experience in programming for his PhD. thesis. Stroustrup found that [[Simula]] had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while [[BCPL]] was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in [[AT&T Bell Labs]], he had the problem of analyzing the [[Unix|UNIX]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] with respect to [[distributed computing]]. Remembering his PhD. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the [[C (programming language)|C]] language with [[Simula]]-like features.<ref name=\"evolving\">{{cite web |url = http://stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf|title = Evolving a language in and for the real world: C++ 1991-2006|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup}}\\n</ref> C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula\\'s influences, other languages also influenced C++, including [[ALGOL 68]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]].\\n\\nInitially, the class, derived class, [[strong typing]], [[inlining]] and [[default argument]] features were added to C via Stroustrup\\'s \"C with Classes\" to C compiler, Cpre.<ref name=\"hopl2\">{{cite web|last1=Stroustrup|first1=Bjarne|title=A History of C ++ : 1979− 1991|url=http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 1983, it was renamed from \\'\\'C with Classes\\'\\' to C++ (\"++\" being the [[increment operator]] in C). New features were added including [[virtual function]]s, function name and [[operator overloading]], references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (<code>//</code>), as well as the development of a proper compiler for C++, [[Cfront]].\\n\\nIn 1985, the first edition of \\'\\'[[The C++ Programming Language]]\\'\\' was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.<ref name=\"1st-edition3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/1st.html|title = The C++ Programming Language|edition = First|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}\\n</ref> The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.<ref name=\"invention3\"/>\\n\\nIn 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of \\'\\'The C++ Programming Language\\'\\' in 1991.<ref name=\"2nd-edition3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.stroustrup.com/2nd.html|title = The C++ Programming Language|edition = Second|first = Bjarne|last = Stroustrup|accessdate = 16 September 2010}}</ref> New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, [[Const correctness|const member functions]], and protected members. In 1990, \\'\\'The Annotated C++ Reference Manual\\'\\' was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included [[Template (programming)|template]]s, [[Exception handling|exceptions]], [[namespaces]], new [[Cast (computer science)|cast]]s, and a [[Boolean datatype|boolean type]].\\n\\nAfter the 2.0 update, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the [[C++11]] standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor [[C++14]] update, released in December 2014, various new additions are [[C++#Standardization|planned for 2017]].\\n\\n=== Etymology ===\\nAccording to Stroustrup: \"the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C\".<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq.html#name |title=Bjarne Stroustrup\\'s FAQ&nbsp;– Where did the name \"C++\" come from? |accessdate=16 January 2008 }}</ref> This name is credited to Rick Mascitti (mid-1983)<ref name=\"hopl2\" /> and was first used in December 1983. When Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he indicated that it was given in a [[tongue-in-cheek]] spirit. The name stems from C\\'s \"++\" [[operator (programming)|operator]] (which [[Increment and decrement operators|increments]] the [[Value (computer science)|value]] of a [[Variable (programming)|variable]]) and a common [[naming convention]] of using \"+\" to indicate an enhanced computer program, implying the language is an \"enhanced\" C, which it shares much syntax with.\\n\\nDuring C++\\'s development period, the language had been referred to as \"new C\" and \"C with Classes\"<ref name=\"hopl2\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=C For C++ Programmers|url=http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/com3620/parent/C-for-Java-C++/c-for-c++-alt.html|publisher=[[Northeastern University]]|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> before acquiring its final name.\\n\\n=== Philosophy ===\\nThroughout C++\\'s life, its development and evolution has been informally governed by a set of rules that its evolution should follow:<ref name=\"evolving\"/>\\n\\n* It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be useful immediately in real world programs.\\n* Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so).\\n* Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C++.\\n* Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++.\\n* It should provide facilities for organising programs into well-defined separate parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts.\\n* No implicit violations of the [[type system]] (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer).\\n* User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types.\\n* Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance).\\n* There should be no language beneath C++ (except [[assembly language]]).\\n* C++ should work alongside other existing [[programming language]]s, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible [[programming environment]].\\n* If the programmer\\'s intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control.\\n\\n=== Standardization ===\\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"margin-left: 1.5em;\"\\n|-\\n!

If the variable has a constructor or initializer this is used to define the initial state of the object.

C++ supports function, class, alias and variable templates. Templates may be parameterized by types, compile-time constants, and other templates. Templates are implemented by \\'\\'instantiation\\'\\' at compile-time. To instantiate a template, compilers substitute specific arguments for a template\\'s parameters to generate a concrete function or class instance. Some substitutions are not possible; these are eliminated by an overload resolution policy described by the phrase \"[[Substitution failure is not an error]]\" (SFINAE). Templates are a powerful tool that can be used for [[generic programming]], [[template metaprogramming]], and code optimization, but this power implies a cost. Template use may increase code size, because each template instantiation produces a copy of the template code: one for each set of template arguments, however, this is the same or smaller amount of code that would be generated if the code was written by hand.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is in contrast to run-time generics seen in other languages (e.g., [[Generics in Java|Java]]) where at compile-time the type is erased and a single template body is preserved.\\n\\nTemplates are different from macros: while both of these compile-time language features enable conditional compilation, templates are not restricted to lexical substitution. Templates are aware of the semantics and type system of their companion language, as well as all compile-time type definitions, and can perform high-level operations including programmatic flow control based on evaluation of strictly type-checked parameters. Macros are capable of conditional control over compilation based on predetermined criteria, but cannot instantiate new types, recurse, or perform type evaluation and in effect are limited to pre-compilation text-substitution and text-inclusion/exclusion. In other words, macros can control compilation flow based on pre-defined symbols but cannot, unlike templates, independently instantiate new symbols. Templates are a tool for static [[Polymorphism in object-oriented programming|polymorphism]] (see below) and [[generic programming]].\\n\\nIn addition, templates are a compile time mechanism in C++ that is [[Turing-complete]], meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, by a [[template metaprogramming|template metaprogram]] prior to runtime.\\n\\nIn summary, a template is a compile-time parameterized function or class written without knowledge of the specific arguments used to instantiate it. After instantiation, the resulting code is equivalent to code written specifically for the passed arguments. In this manner, templates provide a way to decouple generic, broadly applicable aspects of functions and classes (encoded in templates) from specific aspects (encoded in template parameters) without sacrificing performance due to abstraction.\\n\\n=== Objects ===\\n{{Main|C++ classes}}\\n\\nC++ introduces [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP) features to C. It offers [[class (computer science)|class]]es, which provide the four features commonly present in OOP (and some non-OOP) languages: [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[Information hiding|encapsulation]], [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]. One distinguishing feature of C++ classes compared to classes in other programming languages is support for deterministic [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], which in turn provide support for the [[Resource Acquisition is Initialization]] (RAII) concept.\\n\\n==== Encapsulation ====\\n[[Information hiding|Encapsulation]] is the hiding of information to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended and to make the usage model more obvious to the developer. C++ provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary encapsulation mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce encapsulation. A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class (\"friends\"). A protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends.\\n\\nThe OO principle is that all of the functions (and only the functions) that access the internal representation of a type should be encapsulated within the type definition. C++ supports this (via member functions and friend functions), but does not enforce it: the programmer can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and is allowed to make public entities that are not part of the representation of the type. Therefore, C++ supports not just OO programming, but other weaker decomposition paradigms, like [[Modularity (programming)|modular programming]].\\n\\nIt is generally considered good practice to make all [[data]] private or protected, and to make public only those functions that are part of a minimal interface for users of the class. This can hide the details of data implementation, allowing the designer to later fundamentally change the implementation without changing the interface in any way.<ref name=\"cppcs\">{{Cite book |first1=Herb |last1=Sutter |first2=Andrei |last2=Alexandrescu |authorlink1=Herb Sutter |authorlink2=Andrei Alexandrescu |year=2004 |title=C++ Coding Standards: 101 Rules, Guidelines, and Best Practices |publisher = Addison-Wesley }}</ref><ref name=\"industrialcpp\">{{Cite book |last1=Henricson |first1=Mats |last2=Nyquist |first2=Erik |title=Industrial Strength C++ |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1997 |isbn=0-13-120965-5 }}</ref>\\n\\n==== Inheritance ====\\n[[Inheritance (computer science)|Inheritance]] allows one data type to acquire properties of other data types. Inheritance from a [[base class]] may be declared as public, protected, or private. This access specifier determines whether unrelated and derived classes can access the inherited public and protected members of the base class. Only public inheritance corresponds to what is usually meant by \"inheritance\". The other two forms are much less frequently used. If the access specifier is omitted, a \"class\" inherits privately, while a \"struct\" inherits publicly. Base classes may be declared as virtual; this is called [[virtual inheritance]]. Virtual inheritance ensures that only one instance of a base class exists in the inheritance graph, avoiding some of the ambiguity problems of multiple inheritance.\\n\\n[[Multiple inheritance]] is a C++ feature not found in most other languages, allowing a class to be derived from more than one base class; this allows for more elaborate inheritance relationships. For example, a \"Flying Cat\" class can inherit from both \"Cat\" and \"Flying Mammal\". Some other languages, such as [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] or [[Java (programming language)|Java]], accomplish something similar (although more limited) by allowing inheritance of multiple [[Interface (computer science)|interfaces]] while restricting the number of base classes to one (interfaces, unlike classes, provide only declarations of member functions, no implementation or member data). An interface as in C# and Java can be defined in C++ as a class containing only pure virtual functions, often known as an [[abstract base class]] or \"ABC\". The member functions of such an abstract base class are normally explicitly defined in the derived class, not inherited implicitly. C++ virtual inheritance exhibits an ambiguity resolution feature called [[Dominance (C++)|dominance]].\\n\\n=== Operators and operator overloading ===\\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0.5em 0 1em 2em;\"\\n|+ Operators that cannot be overloaded\\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Operator\\n! style=\"width: 9em\" | Symbol\\n|-\\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Scope resolution operator\\n| {{C-lang| ::}}\\n|-\\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Conditional operator\\n| {{C-lang| ?:}}\\n|-\\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | dot operator\\n| {{C-lang| .}}\\n|-\\n\\n|-\\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | Member selection operator\\n| {{C-lang| .*}}\\n|-\\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | \"sizeof\" operator\\n| {{C-lang| sizeof}}\\n|-\\n! style=\"text-align: center\" | \"typeid\" operator\\n| {{C-lang| typeid}}\\n|}\\n\\nC++ provides more than [[Operators in C and C++|35 operators]], covering basic arithmetic, bit manipulation, indirection, comparisons, logical operations and others. Almost all operators can be [[Operator overloading|overloaded]] for user-defined types, with a few notable exceptions such as member access (<code>.</code> and <code>.*</code>) as well as the conditional operator. The rich set of overloadable operators is central to making user-defined types in C++ seem like built-in types.\\n\\nOverloadable operators are also an essential part of many advanced C++ programming techniques, such as [[smart pointer]]s. Overloading an operator does not change the precedence of calculations involving the operator, nor does it change the number of operands that the operator uses (any operand may however be ignored by the operator, though it will be evaluated prior to execution). Overloaded \"<code>&&</code>\" and \"<code>||</code>\" operators lose their [[short-circuit evaluation]] property.\\n\\n=== Polymorphism ===\\n{{See also|Polymorphism in object-oriented programming}}\\n\\n[[Type polymorphism|Polymorphism]] enables one common interface for many implementations, and for objects to act differently under different circumstances.\\n\\nC++ supports several kinds of \\'\\'static\\'\\' ([[compile-time]]) and \\'\\'dynamic\\'\\' ([[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]]) [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]]s, supported by the language features described above. Compile-time polymorphism does not allow for certain run-time decisions, while run-time polymorphism typically incurs a performance penalty.\\n\\n==== Static polymorphism ====\\n{{See also|Parametric polymorphism|ad hoc polymorphism}}\\n\\n[[Function overloading]] allows programs to declare multiple functions having the same name but with different arguments (i.e. [[ad hoc polymorphism|\\'\\'ad hoc\\'\\' polymorphism]]). The functions are distinguished by the number or types of their [[Parameter (computer science)|formal parameter]]s. Thus, the same function name can refer to different functions depending on the context in which it is used. The type returned by the function is not used to distinguish overloaded functions and would result in a compile-time error message.\\n\\nWhen declaring a function, a programmer can specify for one or more parameters a [[default arguments|default value]]. Doing so allows the parameters with defaults to optionally be omitted when the function is called, in which case the default arguments will be used. When a function is called with fewer arguments than there are declared parameters, explicit arguments are matched to parameters in left-to-right order, with any unmatched parameters at the end of the parameter list being assigned their default arguments. In many cases, specifying default arguments in a single function declaration is preferable to providing overloaded function definitions with different numbers of parameters.\\n\\n[[Generic programming#Templates|Templates]] in C++ provide a sophisticated mechanism for writing generic, polymorphic code (i.e. [[parametric polymorphism]]). In particular, through the [[Curiously Recurring Template Pattern]], it\\'s possible to implement a form of static polymorphism that closely mimics the syntax for overriding virtual functions. Because C++ templates are type-aware and [[Turing-complete]], they can also be used to let the compiler resolve recursive conditionals and generate substantial programs through [[template metaprogramming]]. Contrary to some opinion, template code will not generate a bulk code after compilation with the proper compiler settings.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |accessdate=8 March 2010 |publisher=EmptyCrate Software.

This allows arrays and other kinds of containers to hold pointers to objects of differing types. Because assignment of values to variables usually occurs at run-time, this is necessarily a run-time phenomenon.\\n\\nC++ also provides a <code>dynamic_cast</code> operator, which allows the program to safely attempt conversion of an object into an object of a more specific object type (as opposed to conversion to a more general type, which is always allowed). This feature relies on [[run-time type information]] (RTTI). Objects known to be of a certain specific type can also be cast to that type with <code>static_cast</code>, a purely compile-time construct that has no runtime overhead and does not require RTTI.\\n\\n===== Virtual member functions =====\\nOrdinarily, when a function in a derived class [[Method overriding (programming)|overrides]] a function in a base class, the function to call is determined by the type of the object. A given function is overridden when there exists no difference in the number or type of parameters between two or more definitions of that function. Hence, at compile time, it may not be possible to determine the type of the object and therefore the correct function to call, given only a base class pointer; the decision is therefore put off until runtime. This is called [[dynamic dispatch]]. [[virtual functions|Virtual member functions]] or \\'\\'methods\\'\\'<ref>{{Cite book |quote=A virtual member function is sometimes called a \\'\\'method\\'\\'. |first=Bjarne |last=Stroustrup |year=2000 |page=310 |title=The C++ Programming Language |edition=Special |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn = 0-201-70073-5 }}</ref> allow the most specific implementation of the function to be called, according to the actual run-time type of the object. In C++ implementations, this is commonly done using [[virtual function table]]s. If the object type is known, this may be bypassed by prepending a [[fully qualified name|fully qualified class name]] before the function call, but in general calls to virtual functions are resolved at run time.\\n\\nIn addition to standard member functions, operator overloads and destructors can be virtual. As a rule of thumb, if any function in the class is virtual, the destructor should be as well. As the type of an object at its creation is known at compile time, constructors, and by extension copy constructors, cannot be virtual. Nonetheless a situation may arise where a copy of an object needs to be created when a pointer to a derived object is passed as a pointer to a base object. In such a case, a common solution is to create a <code>clone()</code> (or similar) virtual function that creates and returns a copy of the derived class when called.\\n\\nA member function can also be made \"pure virtual\" by appending it with <code>= 0</code> after the closing parenthesis and before the semicolon. A class containing a pure virtual function is called an \\'\\'abstract data type\\'\\'. Objects cannot be created from abstract data types; they can only be derived from. Any derived class inherits the virtual function as pure and must provide a non-pure definition of it (and all other pure virtual functions) before objects of the derived class can be created. A program that attempts to create an object of a class with a pure virtual member function or inherited pure virtual member function is ill-formed.\\n\\n=== Lambda expressions ===\\nC++ provides support for [[anonymous function]]s, which are also known as lambda expressions and have the following form:\\n\\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\\n[capture](parameters) -> return_type { function_body }\\n</source>\\n\\nThe <code>[capture]</code> list supports the definition of [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]]. Such lambda expressions are defined in the standard as [[syntactic sugar]] for an unnamed [[function object]]. An example lambda function may be defined as follows:\\n\\n<source lang=\"cpp\">\\n[](int x, int y) -> int { return x + y; }\\n</source>\\n\\n=== Exception handling ===\\nException handling is used to communicate the existence of a runtime problem or error from where it was detected to where the issue can be handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/CandC++/lecture7.pdf|title = <nowiki>C and C++ Exceptions | Templates</nowiki>|date = 2013|accessdate = July 2014|website = Cambridge Computer Laboratory - Course Materials 2013-14|publisher = |last = Mycroft|first = Alan}}</ref> It permits this to be done in a uniform manner and separately from the main code, while detecting all errors.<ref name=\"exception_summary\">{{Cite book|title = The C++ Programming Language|last = Stroustrup|first = Bjarne|publisher = Addison Wesley|year = 2013|isbn = 9780321563842|location = |pages = 345}}</ref> Should an error occur, an exception is thrown (raised), which is then caught by the nearest suitable exception handler.

In some cases, exceptions cannot be used due to technical reasons. One such example is a critical component of an embedded system, where every operation must be guaranteed to complete within a specified amount of time. This cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the minimum time required for an exception to be handled.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The C++ Programming Language|last = Stroustrup|first = Bjarne|publisher = Addison Wesley|year = 2013|isbn = 9780321563842|location = |pages = 349}}</ref>\\n\\n== Standard library ==\\nThe C++ [[standardization|standard]] consists of two parts: the [[core language]] and the [[C++ Standard Library]]. C++ programmers expect the latter on every major implementation of C++; it includes [[Sequence container (C++)#Vector|vectors]], lists, maps, [[algorithm]]s (find, for_each, binary_search, random_shuffle, etc.), sets, queues, stacks, arrays, tuples, input/output facilities ([[iostream]], for reading from and writing to the console and files), [[smart pointers]] for automatic memory management, [[regular expression]] support, [[Multithreading (software)|multi-threading]] library, atomics support (allowing a variable to be read or written to by at most one thread at a time without any external synchronisation), time utilities (measurement, getting current time, etc.), a system for converting error reporting that doesn\\'t use C++ [[Exception handling|exceptions]] into C++ [[Exception handling|exceptions]], a [[random number generator]] and a slightly modified version of the [[C standard library]] (to make it comply with the C++ type system).\\n\\nA large part of the C++ library is based on the [[Standard Template Library|Standard Template Library (STL)]]. Useful tools provided by the STL include [[container (data structure)|container]]s as the collections of objects (such as [[Array data structure|vector]]s and [[linked list|lists]]), [[iterator]]s that provide array-like access to containers, and [[algorithm]]s that perform operations such as searching and sorting.\\n\\nFurthermore, (multi)maps ([[associative array]]s) and (multi)sets are provided, all of which export compatible interfaces. Therefore, using templates it is possible to write generic algorithms that work with any container or on any sequence defined by iterators. As in C, the [[feature (software design)|feature]]s of the [[Library (computing)|library]] are accessed by using the <code>#include</code> [[directive (programming)|directive]] to include a [[standard header]]. C++ provides 105 [[C++ standard library#Standard headers|standard headers]], of which 27 are deprecated.\\n\\nThe standard incorporates the [[Standard Template Library|STL]] that was originally designed by [[Alexander Stepanov]], who experimented with generic algorithms and containers for many years. When he started with C++, he finally found a language where it was possible to create generic algorithms (e.g., STL sort) that perform even better than, for example, the C standard library qsort, thanks to C++ features like using inlining and compile-time binding instead of function pointers. The standard does not refer to it as \"STL\", as it is merely a part of the standard library, but the term is still widely used to distinguish it from the rest of the standard library (input/output streams, internationalization, diagnostics, the C library subset, etc.).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html |author=Graziano Lo Russo |title=An Interview with A.

From 1960 to 1967, he was a professor of psychology at [[New York University]] (University College of Arts & Sciences, Bronx NY). From 1967 to 1968, he taught at [[Columbia University]]. He joined the faculty at [[Stanford University]] in 1968.\\n\\n==Stanford prison study==\\n{{main article|Stanford prison experiment}}\\n\\n===Background===\\nIn 1971, Zimbardo accepted a tenured position as professor of psychology at Stanford University. With a government grant from the [[Office of Naval Research|U.S. Office of Naval Research]], he conducted the [[Stanford prison study]] in which 24 clinically sane individuals were randomly assigned to be \"prisoners\" or \"guards\" in a mock dungeon located in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford (three additional college students were selected as alternates, only one of whom participated<ref name=\"Stanford Prison\">{{cite web|title=The Stanford Prison Experiment|url=http://documentaryheaven.com/the-stanford-prison-experiment/|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref>  in the study). The planned two-week study into the psychology of prison life ended after only six days due to emotional trauma being experienced by the participants. The students quickly began acting out their roles, with \"guards\" becoming [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] and \"prisoners\" showing extreme [[passivity (behavior)|passivity]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]].\\n\\nThe volunteers knew they were being used in a study but they did not know when the study would be taking place, so the initial shock of being randomly arrested one morning and taken to the mock prison put them in a mild state of shock. On arrival, the \"prisoners\" were stripped, searched, shaved and deloused, which caused a great deal of humiliation. They were then issued uniforms, ID numbers, and escorted to their cells by the volunteer prison guards. The guards themselves were not given any specific instruction or guidelines for the way they were to treat the prisoners besides the fact they were not allowed to use corporal punishment. Instead, the psychologists allowed them to do whatever was needed to keep order in the prison. They were dressed in identical uniforms, wore a whistle around their neck and carried a night stick.\\n\\n===Experiment===\\nAt the beginning of the experiment, Zimbardo started off with nine guards and nine prisoners. All the original volunteers were kept as backups and three prisoners as well as three guards occupied the prison at a time. Their first night in the prison, the volunteer prisoners were awakened at 2:30 AM by the guards blowing their whistles.\\n\\nThe study shows that before the volunteer prisoners started showing signs of distress, they did not take the guards and their authority seriously. The prisoners mocked the guards, trying to regain their individuality. This, however, was short-lived. The prisoners soon realized that the attitude of the guards was very serious and that they demanded obedience. This began a long string of confrontational quarrels between the guards and prisoners.  The guards used physical punishment and exercises, such as pushups, in order to show their authority to the prisoners.\\n\\nIn the morning of only the second day, a rebellion broke out among the volunteer prisoners. They ripped off their uniforms and locked themselves in their cells by pushing their beds up against the door. In response to this, the guards became very angry and called for backup. This surprised Zimbardo as well as the rest of the psychologists because they had not thought it would be taken this far. Guards who were not on duty were called in and the guards who were assigned to only the night shift stayed with the guards who came in all the way through their shift the next morning. The tactic the guards came up with was to fight back in order to discipline the unruly prisoners and make them obey. In response to the prisoners barricading themselves in their cells, the guards used fire extinguishers on them to get them away from the entrances.\\n\\nOnce the guards were able to get into the cells, they stripped the inmates naked, tore apart the beds and the cell, and put the prisoners who had started the rebellion in solitary confinement. As all nine guards could not be on duty at once, they began rewarding the prisoners for good behavior. The prisoners who had not been involved in starting the riot were allowed to lie in their beds, wash themselves and brush their teeth and eat while those who had started the riot were not allowed to. The guards continued to use tormenting tactics to divide the prisoners and forestall further organized resistance. In the case of one prisoner, who was a smoker, the guards were able to control his behavior because they decided when and if he was allowed to smoke.\\n\\nLess than two full days into the experiment, one inmate began suffering from depression, uncontrolled rage, crying and other mental dysfunctions. The prisoner was eventually released after screaming and acting unstable in front of the other inmates. This prisoner was replaced with one of the alternates.<ref name=\"Stanford Prison\"/>\\n\\nOn the third day, the study allowed visiting hours for friends and family. The visitation was closely monitored and timed with many rules and restrictions. The next event that added to the prison experiment \"drama\" was a rumored escape plan that the prisoners were planning on carrying out directly after visiting hours. The prisoner was going to have some of his friends round up, break into the prison and free all of the prisoners. After one of the guards overheard this plan, an informant was placed in among the prisoners and the escape never happened. The prisoners who had been thought to have organized the escape were disciplined and harassed with more pushups and toilet cleaning.\\n\\nAt some point, even the prisoners who were thought of as role models and obeyed all of the guards\\' commands were being punished. Going to the bathroom was considered a privilege rather than a necessity, and those who acted out against the guards were made to urinate and defecate in a bucket in their cell.\\n\\n===Results===\\nBy the end of the experiment, the guards had won complete control over all of their prisoners and were using their authority to its greatest extent.  One prisoner had even gone as far as to go on a hunger strike. When he refused to eat, the guards put him into solitary confinement for three hours (even though their own rules stated the limit that a prisoner could be in solitary confinement was only one hour). Instead of the other prisoners looking at this inmate as a hero and following along in his strike, they chanted together that he was a bad prisoner and a troublemaker. Prisoners and guards had rapidly adapted to their roles, stepping beyond the boundaries of what had been predicted and leading to dangerous and psychologically damaging situations. Zimbardo himself started to give in to the roles of the situation. He had to be shown the reality of the experiment by Christina Maslach, his girlfriend and future wife, who had just received her doctorate in psychology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/97/970108prisonexp.html |title=The Stanford Prison Experiment: Still powerful after all these years (1/97) |publisher=News.stanford.edu |date=August 12, 1996 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> Zimbardo reflects that the message from the experiment is that \"situations can have a more powerful influence over our behaviour than most people appreciate, and few people recognise.\"<ref name=\"Skepticality Episode 49\">{{cite web|title=Skepticality Episode 49|url=http://www.skepticality.com/|publisher=[[Skeptic Magazine]]}}</ref> \\n\\nAt the end of the experiment, after all the prisoners had been released and the guards let go, everyone was brought back into the same room for evaluation and to be able to get their feelings out in the open towards one another. Ethical concerns surrounding the famous study often draw comparisons to the [[Milgram experiment]], which was conducted in 1961 at [[Yale University]] by [[Stanley Milgram]], Zimbardo\\'s former high school friend.\\n\\nThis famous study is not well designed and has several serious experimental flaws:\\n# Zimbardo injected himself into the experiment by playing the role of the prison superintendent. This removed his objectivity as the principal investigator and created \"[[experimenter bias]]\". \\n# One of his colleagues questioned Zimbardo during the experiment, \"What is your Independent Variable?\"  (That is, what factor is causing the effect?) This classic study is a clear example of \"Confounding the Independent Variable\".  There are several possible Independent Variables and none of them are isolated clearly.  \\n# The Dependent Variable (that is, the outcome behavior measurement) is not clearly defined or measured.\\n\\nThese three serious methodological problems must cause this study to be regarded much more as a \"simulation\" rather than as a true \"controlled experiment\". Therefore, this study could be about the effect of roles on behavior, the effect of an authority figure (i.e., Zimbardo) on obedience, the effect of sensory deprivation, the effect of unrestrained power, etc.   Although emotionally dramatic, because of its lack of a properly manipulated and isolated Independent Variable and an objectively defined and measured Dependent Variable, no clear cause and effect relationship can be concluded. This study is not a true experiment and does not clearly \"prove anything\" specific, but rather it can be interpreted and used by anyone as evidence to support many varied points of view. {{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; This seems like personal opinion.|date=July 2016}}\\n\\n===Prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib Prison===\\n{{Further|Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse}}\\nZimbardo reflects on the dramatic visual similarities between the behaviour of the participants in the [[Stanford prison experiment]], and the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib]]. He did not accept the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Richard Myers|General Myers]]\\' claim that the events were due to a few rogue soldiers and that it did not reflect on the military. Instead he looked at the situation the soldiers were in and considered the possibility that this situation might have induced the behaviour that they displayed. He began with the assumption that were probably \"good apples\" in a situation like that of the Stanford prison experiment, where he knew that physically and psychologically normal and healthy people were behaving sadistically and brutalising prisoners.<ref name=\"Skepticality Episode 49\"/>\\n\\nZimbardo became absorbed in trying to understand who these people were, asking the question \"are they inexplicable, can we not understand them\". This is what led him to write the book \\'\\'The Lucifer Effect\\'\\'.<ref name=\"Skepticality Episode 49\"/>\\n\\n==\\'\\'The Lucifer Effect\\'\\'==\\nZimbardo\\'s book, \\'\\'The Lucifer Effect\\'\\',<ref>{{cite book|last=Zimbardo|first=Philip|title=The Lucifer Effect|year=2007|publisher=The Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-6411-3}}</ref> gets its title from the metamorphosis of [[Lucifer]] into [[Satan]]. Though the Christian Scriptures do not make this claim, according to the Biblical account, Lucifer was once God\\'s favorite angel until he challenged God\\'s authority and was cast into Hell with all the other fallen angels. Thus, Zimbardo derives this title to explain how good people turn evil. Zimbardo\\'s main assumption on why good people do terrible things is due to situational influences and power given from authority.\\n\\n\\'\\'The Lucifer Effect\\'\\' was written in response to his findings in the [[Stanford Prison Experiment]]. Zimbardo believes that personality characteristics could play a role in how violent or submissive actions are manifested. In the book, Zimbardo says that humans cannot be defined as good or evil because we have the ability to act as both especially at the hand of the situation. Examples include the events that occurred at the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib Detention Center]], in which the defense team—including [[Gary Myers (lawyer)|Gary Myers]]—argued that it was not the prison guards and interrogators that were at fault for the physical and mental abuse of detainees but the Bush administration policies themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Panel blames Bush officials for detainee abuse|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28180540/#.Vo7gofkrKUk|website = msnbc.com|accessdate = 2016-01-07}}</ref> According to Zimbardo, \"Good people can be induced, seduced, and initiated into behaving in evil ways. They can also be led to act in irrational, stupid, self-destructive, antisocial, and mindless ways when they are immersed in \\'total situations\\' that impact human nature in ways that challenge our sense of the stability and consistency of individual personality, of character, and of morality.\"\\n\\nHe also notes that we as humans wish to believe in unchanging goodness of people and our power to resist situational and external pressures and temptations. In chapter 12, \"Investigating Social Dynamics: Power, Conformity, and Obedience,\" Zimbardo discusses that [[peer pressure]], the desire to be \\'cool,\\' the fear of rejection, and simply being a part of a group are the focal points to acting preposterous to your character.\\n\\nIn \\'\\'[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]\\'\\',<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=September 19, 2007|volume=298|issue=11|pages=1338–1340|accessdate=}}</ref>  Zimbardo\\'s situational perspective received support from other social situational experiments that demonstrated the same idea and concept. Almost ten years prior to the Stanford Prison Experiment (1971), [[Stanley Milgram]] conducted research on obedient behavior in 1965 that embraced situational forces. Milgram had \"teachers\" that delivered mock electric shocks to the \"learner\" for every wrong answer that was given in a multiple choice test. The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to the learners. At the end of the experiment, 65% of men ages 20–50 complied fully up to the very last voltage. In the same room as the teacher, there was a \"confederate\" that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of the study, participants signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate of teachers who did continue to shock the learners, there was a situational force. The situational force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, \"I advise you to continue with this experiment\" or \"I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks\" and the one that caught most teachers was \"You must continue with the shocks.\" Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate\\'s voice demanding they proceed.\\n\\nBoth Milgram and Zimbardo\\'s experiment tested situational forces on an individual. Both results concluded that irrational behavior compared to one\\'s character is plausible for any human because we have both tendencies in our nature. Both studies are frequently cited as examples of psychological experiments that were conducted in the mid-20th century that have serious ethical problems involving the treatment of human experimental participants and not clearly explained informed consent.  Both studies probably could not receive approval today from any university board of ethics.\\n\\nThere are 7 social processes that grease \"the slippery slope of evil\":<ref>The psychology of evil | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsFEV35tWsg</ref>\\n* Mindlessly taking the first small step\\n* Dehumanization of others\\n* De-individuation of self (anonymity)\\n* Diffusion of personal responsibility\\n* Blind obedience to authority\\n* Uncritical conformity to group norms\\n* Passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference\\n\\n==Time==\\nIn 2008, Zimbardo published his work with [[John Boyd (author)|John Boyd]] about the Time Perspective Theory and the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI) in \\'\\'The Time Paradox: The New Psychology of Time That Will Change Your Life\\'\\'.

Zimbardo, Berlin, Germany, 2008]]\\n\\nAfter the prison experiment, Zimbardo decided to look for ways he could use psychology to help people; this led to the founding of [[The Shyness Clinic]] in [[Menlo Park, California]], which treats [[shyness|shy behavior]] in adults and children. Zimbardo\\'s research on shyness resulted in several bestselling books on the topic. Other subjects he has researched include [[mind control]] and [[cult]]ic behavior.<ref name=\"apamonitor\">[http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/study_zimbar.htm What messages are behind today\\'s cults?], APA Monitor, May 1997</ref>\\n\\nZimbardo is the co-author of an introductory Psychology textbook entitled \\'\\'Psychology and Life\\'\\', which is used in many American undergraduate psychology courses.

[[Ivan Frederick|Ivan \"Chip\" Frederick]], a guard at [[Abu Ghraib prison]]. He argued that Frederick\\'s sentence should be lessened due to mitigating circumstances, explaining that few individuals can resist the powerful situational pressures of a prison, particularly without proper training and supervision. The judge apparently disregarded Zimbardo\\'s testimony, and gave Frederick the maximum 8-year sentence. Zimbardo drew on the knowledge he gained from his participation in the Frederick case to write a new book entitled, \\'\\'The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil\\'\\', about the connections between Abu Ghraib and the prison experiments.<ref>{{cite web|author=James Bone Rome Updated 36 minutes ago |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article1576761.ece |title=The Times &#124; UK News, World News and Opinion |publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\\n\\nIn September 2006, Zimbardo joined the faculty at [[Palo Alto University]] as Professor of Psychology, where he teaches [[social psychology]] to doctoral students in the [[clinical psychology]] program.

Born into a [[Quaker]] family committed to social equality, she collected [[anti-slavery movement|anti-slavery]] petitions at the age of 17.  In 1856, she became the New York state agent for the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]].\\n\\nIn 1851, she met [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who became her lifelong friend and co-worker in social reform activities, primarily in the field of [[women\\'s rights]].  In 1852, they founded the New York Women\\'s State Temperance Society after Anthony was prevented from speaking at a [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] conference because she was female. In 1863, they founded the [[Women\\'s Loyal National League]], which conducted the largest petition drive in United States history up to that time, collecting nearly 400,000 signatures in support of the abolition of slavery.  In 1866, they initiated the [[American Equal Rights Association]], which campaigned for equal rights for both women and African Americans.  In 1868, they began publishing a women\\'s rights newspaper called \\'\\'[[The Revolution (newspaper)|The Revolution]]\\'\\'.  In 1869, they founded the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] as part of a split in the women\\'s movement.  In 1890, the split was formally healed when their organization merged with the rival [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], with Anthony as its key force.  In 1876, Anthony and Stanton began working with [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] on what eventually grew into the six-volume \\'\\'[[History of Woman Suffrage]]\\'\\'.  The interests of Anthony and Stanton diverged somewhat in later years, but the two remained close friends.\\n\\nIn 1872, Anthony was arrested for voting in her hometown of [[Rochester, New York]], and convicted in a widely publicized trial.  Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action.  In 1878, Anthony and Stanton arranged for Congress to be presented with an amendment giving women the right to vote.  Popularly known as the Anthony Amendment and introduced by Sen.  Aaron A. Sargent (R-CA), it became the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] in 1920.\\n\\nAnthony traveled extensively in support of women\\'s suffrage, giving as many as 75 to 100 speeches per year and working on many state campaigns.  She worked internationally for women\\'s rights, playing a key role in creating the [[International Council of Women]], which is still active.  She also helped to bring about the [[World\\'s Congress of Representative Women]] at the [[World\\'s Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893.\\n\\nWhen she first began campaigning for women\\'s rights, Anthony was harshly ridiculed and accused of trying to destroy the institution of marriage.  Public perception of her changed radically during her lifetime, however.  Her 80th birthday was celebrated in the White House at the invitation of President [[William McKinley]].  She became the first nonfictitious woman to be depicted on U.S. coinage when her portrait appeared on the [[Susan B. Anthony dollar|1979 dollar coin]]. Kys\\n\\n==Biography==\\n\\n===Early life===\\n\\nSusan Brownell Anthony was born on February 15, 1820, to Daniel Anthony and Lucy Read in [[Adams, Massachusetts]], the second oldest of seven children. Her family shared a passion for social reform.  Her brothers [[Daniel Read Anthony|Daniel]] and Merritt moved to [[Kansas]] to support the [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]] there.  Merritt fought with [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] against pro-slavery forces during the [[Bleeding Kansas]] crisis.  Daniel eventually owned a newspaper and became mayor of [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]].<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n197/mode/2up, pp. 144, 231]</ref>\\nAnthony\\'s sister [[Mary Stafford Anthony|Mary]], with whom she shared a home in later years, became a public school principal in Rochester, and a woman\\'s rights activist.<ref>[http://www.rochester.lib.ny.us/~rochhist/v7_1945/v7i2.pdf McKelvey (April 1945)], pp. 16, 18</ref>\\n\\nAnthony\\'s father was an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] and a [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] advocate. A [[Quaker]], he had a difficult relationship with his traditionalist congregation, which rebuked him for marrying a non-Quaker and then disowned him for allowing a dance school to operate in his home. He continued to attend Quaker meetings anyway and became even more radical in his beliefs. Anthony\\'s mother was not a Quaker but helped raise their children in a more tolerant version of her husband\\'s religious tradition. Their father encouraged them all, girls as well as boys, to be self-supporting, teaching them business principles and giving them responsibilities at an early age.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n81/mode/2up, pp. 10, 37, 57]</ref>\\n\\nWhen Anthony was six years old, her family moved to [[Battenville, New York]], where her father managed a large cotton mill. Previously he had operated his own small cotton factory. When she was seventeen, Anthony was sent to a Quaker [[boarding school]] in Philadelphia, where she unhappily endured its severe atmosphere. She was forced to end her studies after one term because her family was financially ruined during an economic downturn known as the [[Panic of 1837]]. They were forced to sell everything they had at an auction, but they were rescued by her maternal uncle, who bought most of their belongings and restored them to the family. To assist her family financially, Anthony left home to teach at a Quaker boarding school.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n55/mode/2up pp. 11, 17, 24–31, 35, 39]</ref>\\n[[File:Susan Brownell Anthony - Age 28 - Project Gutenberg eText 15220.jpg|thumb|left|Headmistress Susan B. Anthony in 1848 at age 28]]\\n\\nIn 1845, the family moved to a farm on the outskirts of [[Rochester, New York]], purchased partly with the inheritance of Anthony\\'s mother.  There they associated with a group of Quaker social reformers who had left their congregation because of the restrictions it placed on reform activities, and who in 1848 formed a new organization called the Congregational Friends. The Anthony farmstead soon became the Sunday afternoon gathering place for local activists, including [[Frederick Douglass]], a former slave and a prominent [[abolitionist]] who became Anthony\\'s lifelong friend.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n109/mode/2up pp. 45–46, 60]</ref><ref>Hugh Barbour, Christopher Densmore, Elizabeth H.

ISBN 0-8156-2664-9.</ref>\\n\\nAs several others in that group were already doing, the Anthony family began to attend services at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester]], which was associated with social reform.  The [[Rochester Women\\'s Rights Convention of 1848]] was held at that church in 1848, inspired by the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women\\'s rights convention, which was held two weeks earlier in a nearby town. Anthony\\'s parents and her sister Mary attended the Rochester convention and signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]] that had been first adopted by the Seneca Falls Convention.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n107/mode/2up p. 59]</ref>\\n\\nAnthony did not take part in either of these conventions because she had moved to [[Canajoharie (village), New York|Canajoharie]] in 1846 to be headmistress of the female department of the Canajoharie Academy.  Away from Quaker influences for the first time in her life, at the age of 26 she began to replace her plain clothing with more stylish dresses, and she quit using \"thee\" and other forms of speech traditionally used by Quakers.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1,  [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n93/mode/2up pp.  49–50]</ref> She was interested in social reform, and she was distressed at being paid much less than men with similar jobs, but she was amused at her father\\'s enthusiasm over the Rochester women\\'s rights convention.  She later explained, \"I wasn\\'t ready to vote, didn\\'t want to vote, but I did want equal pay for equal work.\"<ref>National Woman Suffrage Association, \\'\\' Report of the International Council of Women, Volume 1\\'\\', 1888, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eagEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA327 p. 327]</ref>\\n\\nWhen the Canajoharie Academy closed in 1849, Anthony took over the operation of the family farm in Rochester so her father could devote more time to his insurance business.  She worked at this task for a couple of years but found herself increasingly drawn to reform activity.  With her parents\\' support, she was soon fully engaged in reform work.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1,  [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n101/mode/2up pp. 55–56]</ref> For the rest of her life, she lived almost entirely on fees she earned as a speaker.<ref>Sherr (1995), p. 226</ref>\\n\\n===Early social activism===\\n\\n{{Quote box\\n | quote  = Cautious, careful people, always casting about to preserve their reputation and social standing, never can bring about a reform.

Anthony, 1860<ref>Quoted in Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n255/mode/2up, p. 197]</ref>}}\\n\\nAnthony embarked on her career of social reform with energy and determination.  Schooling herself in reform issues, she found herself drawn to the more radical ideas of people like [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]].  Soon she was wearing the controversial [[Bloomers (clothing)|Bloomer dress]], consisting of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress.  Although it was more sensible than the traditional heavy dresses that dragged the ground, she reluctantly quit wearing it after a year because it gave her opponents the opportunity to focus on her apparel rather than her ideas.<ref>Barry (1988), pp. 60–61, 82</ref>\\n\\n====Partnership with Elizabeth Cady Stanton====\\n[[File:Elizabeth Cady Stanton by HB Hall.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Cady Stanton]]\\n\\nIn 1851, Anthony was introduced to [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who had been one of the organizers of the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] and had introduced the controversial resolution in support of [[women\\'s suffrage]].  Anthony and Stanton soon became close friends and co-workers, forming a relationship that was pivotal for them and for the women\\'s movement as a whole.  After the Stantons moved from Seneca Falls to New York City in 1861, a room was set aside for Anthony in every house they lived in. One of Stanton\\'s biographers estimated that over her lifetime, Stanton spent more time with Anthony than with any other adult, including her own husband.<ref>Griffith (1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Tfx_gVHXcMC&pg=PA224 pp. 108, 224]</ref>\\n\\nThe two women had complementary skills.  Anthony excelled at organizing, while Stanton had an aptitude for intellectual matters and writing.  Anthony was dissatisfied with her own writing ability and wrote relatively little for publication.  When historians illustrate her thoughts with direct quotes, they usually take them from her speeches, letters and diary entries.<ref>For Anthony\\'s lack of confidence in her writing ability, see letter from Anthony to Stanton, June 5, 1856, quoted in Sherr (1995), p. 22</ref>\\n\\nBecause Stanton was homebound with seven children while Anthony was unmarried and free to travel, Anthony assisted Stanton by supervising her children while Stanton wrote. One of Anthony\\'s biographers said, \"Susan became one of the family and was almost another mother to Mrs. Stanton\\'s children.\"<ref name=barry-64>Barry (1988), p. 64</ref>\\nA biography of Stanton says that during the early years of their relationship, \"Stanton provided the ideas, rhetoric, and strategy; Anthony delivered the speeches, circulated petitions, and rented the halls.  Anthony prodded and Stanton produced.\"<ref>Griffith (1984), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Tfx_gVHXcMC&pg=PA74 p. 74]</ref>\\nStanton\\'s husband said, \"Susan stirred the puddings, Elizabeth stirred up Susan, and then Susan stirs up the world!\"<ref>Letter from Stanton to Anthony, August 20, 1857, quoted in Griffith (1984), p. 74</ref>  \\nStanton herself said, \"I forged the thunderbolts, she fired them.\"<ref>Stanton (1898) [https://books.google.com/books?id=xooEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA165 p. 165].</ref>\\nBy 1854, Anthony and Stanton \"had perfected a collaboration that made the New York State movement the most sophisticated in the country\", according to [[Ann D. Gordon]], a professor of women\\'s history.<ref>Gordon (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dBs4CO1DsF4C&pg=PR30 p. xxx]</ref>\\n\\n====Temperance activities====\\n\\n[[temperance movement in the United States|Temperance]] was very much a women\\'s rights issue at that time because of laws that gave husbands complete control of the family and its finances.  A woman with a drunken husband had little legal recourse even if his alcoholism left the family destitute and he was abusive to her and their children. If she obtained a divorce, which was difficult to do, he could easily end up with guardianship of the children.<ref>Flexner (1959), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA58 p. 58]</ref>\\n\\nWhile teaching in Canajoharie, Anthony joined the Daughters of Temperance and in 1849 gave her first public speech at one of its meetings.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n99/mode/2up, p. 53]</ref>\\nIn 1852, she was elected as a delegate to the state temperance convention, but the chairman stopped her when she tried to speak, saying that women delegates were there only to listen and learn. Anthony and some other women immediately walked out and announced a meeting of their own, which created a committee to organize a women\\'s state convention. Largely organized by Anthony, the convention of 500 women met in Rochester in April and created the Women\\'s State Temperance Society, with Stanton as president and Anthony as state agent.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n113/mode/2up, pp. 64–68]</ref>\\n\\nAnthony and her co-workers collected 28,000 signatures on a petition for a law to prohibit the sale of alcohol in New York State.  She organized a hearing on that law before the New York legislature, the first that had been initiated in that state by a group of women.  At the organization\\'s convention the following year, however, conservative members attacked Stanton\\'s advocacy of the right of a wife of an alcoholic to obtain a divorce.  Stanton was voted out as president, whereupon she and Anthony resigned from the organization.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n145/mode/2up, pp. 81–82,  92–95]</ref>\\n\\nIn 1853, Anthony attended the World\\'s Temperance Convention in New York City, which bogged down for three chaotic days in a dispute about whether women would be allowed to speak there.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n151/mode/2up, pp. 101–02]</ref>\\nYears later, Anthony observed, \"No advanced step taken by women has been so bitterly contested as that of speaking in public. For nothing which they have attempted, not even to secure the suffrage, have they been so abused, condemned and antagonized.\"<ref>Susan B. Anthony, \"Fifty Years of Work for Woman\" \\'\\'Independent\\'\\', 52 (February 15, 1900), pp. 414–17, quoted in Sherr (1995), p. 134</ref> After this period, Anthony focused her energy on abolitionist and women\\'s rights activities.\\n\\n====Teachers\\' conventions====\\nWhen Anthony tried to speak at the [[New York State Teachers\\' Association]] meeting in 1853, her attempt sparked a half-hour debate among the men about whether it was proper for women to speak in public.  Finally allowed to continue, Anthony said, \"Do you not see that so long as society says a woman is incompetent to be a lawyer, minister, or doctor, but has ample ability to be a teacher, that every man of you who chooses this profession tacitly acknowledges that he has no more brains than a woman.\"<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881–1922), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu01stanuoft#page/514/mode/2up pp. 513–14]</ref>\\nAt the 1857 teacher\\'s convention, she introduced a resolution calling for the admission of black people to public schools and colleges, but it was rejected as \"not a proper subject for discussion.\"<ref>\\'\\'National Anti-Slavery Standard\\'\\', August 15, 1857, quoted in Sherr (1995), p. 18</ref> When she introduced another resolution calling for males and females to be educated together at all levels, including colleges, it was fiercely opposed and decisively rejected.  One opponent called the idea \"a vast social evil... the first step in the school which seeks to abolish marriage, and behind this picture I see a monster of social deformity.\"<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n209/mode/2up, pp. 155–56]</ref>\\n\\nAnthony continued to speak at state teachers\\' conventions for several years, insisting that women teachers should receive equal pay with men and serve as officers and committee members within the organization.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n277/mode/2up, p. 221]</ref>\\n\\n====Early women\\'s rights activities====\\nAnthony\\'s work for the women\\'s rights movement began at a time when that movement was already gathering momentum.  Stanton had helped organize the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] in 1848, a local event that was the first women\\'s rights convention.  In 1850, the first in a series of [[National Women\\'s Rights Convention]]s was held in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].  In 1852, Anthony attended her first National Women\\'s Rights Convention, which was held in [[Syracuse, New York]], where she served as one of the convention\\'s secretaries.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1,  [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n121/mode/2up p. 72]</ref> According to [[Ida Husted Harper]], Anthony\\'s authorized biographer, \"Miss Anthony came away from the Syracuse convention thoroughly convinced that the right which woman needed above every other, the one indeed which would secure to her all others, was the right of suffrage.\"<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n129/mode/2up, p. 81]</ref> Suffrage, however, did not become the main focus of her work for several more years.\\n\\nA major hindrance to the women\\'s movement was a lack of money.  Few women at that time had an independent source of income, and even those with employment generally were required by law to turn over their pay to their husbands.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA17 p. 17]</ref> \\nPartly through the efforts of the women\\'s movement, a law had been passed in New York in 1848 that recognized some rights for married women, but that law was limited.  In 1853, Anthony worked with [[William Henry Channing]], her activist [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian]] minister, to organize a convention in Rochester to launch a state campaign for improved property rights for married women, which Anthony would lead. She took her lecture and petition campaign into almost every county in New York during the winter of 1855 despite the difficulty of traveling in snowy terrain in horse and buggy days.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n179/mode/2up pp. 104, 122-28]</ref>\\n\\nWhen she presented the petitions to the New York State Senate Judiciary Committee, its members told her that men were actually the oppressed sex because they did such things as giving women the best seats in carriages. Noting cases in which the petition had been signed by both husbands and wives (instead of the husband signing for both, which was the standard procedure), the committee\\'s official report sarcastically recommended that the petitioners seek a law authorizing the husbands in such marriages to wear petticoats and the wives trousers.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n193/mode/2up pp. 140–41]</ref>\\nThe campaign finally achieved success in 1860 when the legislature passed an improved [[Married Women\\'s Property Acts in the United States|Married Women\\'s Property Act]] that gave married women the right to own separate property, enter into contracts and be joint guardian of their children. The legislature rolled back much of this law in 1862, however, during a period when the women\\'s movement was largely inactive because of the [[American Civil War]].<ref>Barry (1988), pp. 136, 149</ref>\\n\\nThe women\\'s movement was loosely structured at that time, with few state organizations and no national organization other than a coordinating committee that arranged annual conventions.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 109, 121</ref>\\n[[Lucy Stone]], who did much of the organizational work for the national conventions, encouraged Anthony to take over some of the responsibility for them.  Anthony resisted at first, feeling that she was needed more in the field of anti-slavery activities.  After organizing a series of anti-slavery meetings in the winter of 1857, Anthony told a friend that, \"the experience of the last winter is worth more to me than all my temperance and woman\\'s rights work, though the latter were the school necessary to bring me into the antislavery work.\"<ref>Letter from Anthony to [[Abby Kelley Foster]] and [[Stephen Symonds Foster]], April 20, 1857, quoted in Million (2003), p. 234</ref> \\nDuring a planning session for the 1858 women\\'s rights convention, Stone, who had recently given birth, told Anthony that her new family responsibilities would prevent her from organizing conventions until her children were older.  Anthony presided at the 1858 convention, and when the planning committee for national conventions was reorganized, Stanton became its president and Anthony its secretary.<ref>Million (2003), pp. 235, 250–52</ref>\\nAnthony continued to be heavily involved in anti-slavery work at the same time.\\n\\n====Anti-slavery activities====\\nIn 1837, at age 16, Anthony collected petitions against slavery as part of organized resistance to the newly established [[Gag rule#United States|gag rule]] that prohibited anti-slavery petitions in the U.S. House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Anti-Slavery Impulse:1830–1844 |last=Barnes |first=Gilbert Hobbs |year=1964 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace & World |location=New York |isbn= |page= 143}} This citation references the 1964 edition of a book that was first published in 1933 by the American Historical Association.</ref>\\nIn 1851, she played a key role in organizing an anti-slavery convention in Rochester.<ref>[http://www.rochester.lib.ny.us/~rochhist/v7_1945/v7i2.pdf  McKelvey (April 1945)], p. 6</ref>\\nShe was also part of the [[Underground Railroad]].

In a speech in 1861, Anthony said, \"Let us open to the colored man all our schools ... Let us admit him into all our mechanic shops, stores, offices, and lucrative business avocations ... let him rent such pew in the church, and occupy such seat in the theatre ... Extend to him all the rights of Citizenship.\"<ref>Manuscript of speech in the Susan B. Anthony Papers collection at the Library of Congress. Quoted in McPherson (1964), [https://books.google.com/books?id=fdE1jAheJwkC&pg=PA225 p. 225]</ref>\\n\\nThe relatively small women\\'s rights movement of that time was closely associated with the abolitionist movement, especially the American Anti-Slavery Society led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. The women\\'s movement depended heavily on abolitionist resources, with its articles published in their newspapers and some of its funding provided by abolitionists.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA51 p. 51]</ref> There was tension, however, between leaders of the women\\'s movement and male abolitionists who, although supporters of increased women\\'s rights, believed that a vigorous campaign for women\\'s rights would interfere with the campaign against slavery. In 1860, when Anthony sheltered a woman who had fled an abusive husband, Garrison insisted that the woman give up the child she had brought with her, pointing out that the law gave husbands complete control of children.  Anthony reminded Garrison that he helped slaves escape to Canada in violation of the law and said, \"Well, the law which gives the father ownership of the children is just as wicked and I\\'ll break it just as quickly.\"<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1,  [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n263/mode/2up p. 204]</ref>\\n\\nWhen Stanton introduced a resolution at the National Woman\\'s Rights Convention in 1860 favoring more lenient divorce laws, leading abolitionist [[Wendell Phillips]] not only opposed it but attempted to have it removed from the record.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA36 p. 36]. The proposal for more lenient divorce laws was also controversial among women activists.</ref> When Stanton, Anthony, and others supported a bill before the New York legislature that would permit divorce in cases of desertion or inhuman treatment, [[Horace Greeley]], an abolitionist newspaper publisher, campaigned against it in the pages of his newspaper.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1881–1922), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu01stanuoft#page/744/mode/2up pp. 745–46]</ref>\\n\\nGarrison, Phillips and Greeley had all provided valuable help to the women\\'s movement.

The League was called by several variations of its name, including the Women\\'s National Loyal League.</ref>\\nThe petition drive significantly assisted the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which ended slavery.  Anthony was the chief organizer of this effort, which involved recruiting and coordinating some 2000 petition collectors.<ref>Barry (1988), pp. 153-154</ref>\\n\\nThe League provided the women\\'s movement with a vehicle for combining the fight against slavery with the fight for women\\'s rights by reminding the public that petitioning was the only political tool available to women at a time when only men were allowed to vote.<ref>Venet (1991), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PfE0ULar1JgC&pg=PA116 p. 116]</ref>\\nWith a membership of 5000, it helped develop a new generation of women leaders, providing experience and recognition for not only Stanton and Anthony but also newcomers like [[Anna Elizabeth Dickinson|Anna Dickinson]], a gifted teenaged orator.<ref>Venet (1991), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PfE0ULar1JgC&pg=PA106 pp. 148-149].</ref>\\nThe League demonstrated the value of formal structure to a women\\'s movement that had resisted being anything other than loosely organized up to that point.<ref>Flexner (1959), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA105 p. 105]</ref>\\nThe widespread network of women activists who assisted the League expanded the pool of talent that was available to reform movements, including the women\\'s suffrage movement, after the war.<ref>Venet (1991), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PfE0ULar1JgC&pg=PA1 pp. 1–2].</ref>\\n\\n===American Equal Rights Association===\\nAnthony stayed with her brother [[Daniel Read Anthony|Daniel]] in Kansas for eight months in 1865 to assist with his newspaper. She headed back east after she learned that an amendment to the U.S. Constitution had been proposed that would provide citizenship for African Americans but would also for the first time introduce the word \"male\" into the constitution.  Anthony supported citizenship for blacks but opposed any attempt to link it with a reduction in the status of women.  Her ally Stanton agreed, saying \"if that word \\'male\\' be inserted, it will take us a century at least to get it out.\"<ref>Letter from Stanton to Gerrit Smith, January 1, 1866, quoted in DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA61 p. 61]</ref>\\n\\nAnthony and Stanton worked to revive the women\\'s rights movement, which had become nearly dormant during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  In 1866, they organized the Eleventh [[National Women\\'s Rights Convention]], the first since the Civil War began.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/152/mode/2up pp. 152-53]</ref>\\nUnanimously adopting a resolution introduced by Anthony, the convention voted to transform itself into the [[American Equal Rights Association]] (AERA), whose purpose was to campaign for the equal rights of all citizens, especially the right of suffrage.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/170/mode/2up pp. 171-72]</ref>\\n\\nThe leadership of the new organization included such prominent activists as [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Frederick Douglass]].  Its drive for [[universal suffrage]], however, was resisted by some abolitionist leaders and their allies in the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], who wanted women to postpone their campaign for suffrage until after it had been achieved for male African Americans.  [[Horace Greeley]], a prominent newspaper editor, told Anthony and Stanton, \"This is a critical period for the Republican Party and the life of our Nation... I conjure you to remember that this is \\'the negro\\'s hour,\\' and your first duty now is to go through the State and plead his claims.\"<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/270/mode/2up p. 270]</ref> Anthony and Stanton refused to postpone their demands and continued to push for [[universal suffrage]].\\n\\nIn 1867, the AERA campaigned in Kansas for [[referendum|referenda]] that would [[suffrage|enfranchise]] both African Americans and women. [[Wendell Phillips]], an abolitionist leader who opposed mixing those two causes, blocked the funding that the AERA had expected for their campaign.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA105 p. 105]</ref>\\nAfter an internal struggle, Kansas Republicans decided to support suffrage for black men only and formed an \"Anti Female Suffrage Committee\" to oppose the AERA\\'s efforts.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA124 pp. 124, 127]</ref> \\nBy the end of summer, the AERA campaign had almost collapsed, and its finances were exhausted.\\nAnthony and Stanton created a storm of controversy by accepting help during the last days of the campaign from [[George Francis Train]], a wealthy businessman who supported women\\'s rights. Train antagonized many activists by attacking the Republican Party and openly disparaging the integrity and intelligence of African Americans.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA93 pp. 93-94].</ref>\\nThere is reason to believe, however, that Anthony and Stanton hoped to draw the volatile Train away from his cruder forms of racism, and that he had actually begun to do so.<ref>Dudden (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA137 pp. 137 and 246, footnotes 22 and 25]</ref>\\n\\nAfter the Kansas campaign, the AERA increasingly divided into two wings, both advocating universal suffrage but with different approaches.  One wing, whose leading figure was Lucy Stone, was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first and wanted to maintain close ties with the Republican Party and the abolitionist movement. The other, whose leading figures were Anthony and Stanton, insisted that women and black men should be enfranchised at the same time and worked toward a politically independent women\\'s movement that would no longer be dependent on abolitionists. The AERA effectively dissolved after an acrimonious meeting in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations were created in its aftermath.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA80 pp. 80-81, 189, 196].</ref>\\n\\n===\\'\\'The Revolution\\'\\'===\\nAnthony and Stanton began publishing a weekly newspaper called \\'\\'[[The Revolution (newspaper)|The Revolution]]\\'\\' in New York City in 1868. It focused primarily on women\\'s rights, especially suffrage for women, but it also covered other topics, including politics, the labor movement and finance. Its motto was \"Men, their rights and nothing more: women, their rights and nothing less.\"<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA18 p. 18]</ref>\\nOne of its goals was to provide a forum in which women could exchange opinions on key issues from a variety of viewpoints. Anthony managed the business aspects of the paper while Stanton was co-editor along with [[Parker Pillsbury]], an abolitionist and a supporter of women\\'s rights. Initial funding was provided by [[George Francis Train]], the controversial businessman who supported women\\'s rights but who alienated many activists with his political and racial views.<ref name=rakow-14-18>Rakow and Kramarae eds.

After twenty-nine months, mounting debts forced Anthony to transfer the paper to [[Laura Curtis Bullard]], a wealthy women\\'s rights activist who gave it a less radical tone. The paper published its last issue less than two years later.<ref name=rakow-14-18/>\\nDespite its short life, \\'\\'The Revolution\\'\\' gave Anthony and Stanton a means for expressing their views during the developing split within the women\\'s movement. It also helped them promote their wing of the movement, which eventually became a separate organization.<ref>The role of \\'\\'The Revolution\\'\\' during the developing split in the women\\'s movement is discussed in chapters 6 and 7 of Dudden (2011).  An example of its use to support their wing of the movement is on [https://books.google.com/books?id=7-XV-oP9UFUC&pg=PA164 page 164].</ref>\\n\\n===Attempted alliance with labor===\\nThe [[National Labor Union]] (NLU), which was formed in 1866, began reaching out to farmers, African Americans and women, with the intention of forming a broad-based political party.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA112 pp. 112, 114].</ref> \\'\\'The Revolution\\'\\' responded enthusiastically, declaring, \"The principles of the National Labor Union are our principles.\"<ref>\"The National Labor Union and U.S. Bonds,\" \\'\\'The Revolution\\'\\', April 9, 1868, p. 213. Quoted in DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA110 p. 110].</ref> It predicted that \"The producers—the working-men, the women, the negroes—are destined to form a triple power that shall speedily wrest the sceptre of government from the non-producers—the land monopolists, the bond-holders, the politicians.\"<ref>\"National Labor Congress,\" \\'\\'The Revolution\\'\\', October 1, 1868, p. 200.</ref>\\nAnthony and Stanton were seated as delegates to the NLU Congress in 1868, with Anthony representing the [[Working Women\\'s Association]] (WWA), which had recently been formed in the offices of \\'\\'The Revolution\\'\\'.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA123 pp. 123, 133].</ref>\\n\\nThe attempted alliance did not last long. During a printers\\' [[strike action|strike]] in 1869, Anthony voiced approval of an employer-sponsored training program that would teach women skills that would enable them in effect to replace the strikers.  Anthony viewed the program as an opportunity to increase employment of women in a trade from which women were often excluded by both employers and unions. At the next NLU Congress, Anthony was first seated as a delegate but then unseated because of strong opposition from those who accused her of supporting [[strikebreakers]].<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA155 pp. 155–59].</ref>\\n\\nAnthony worked with the WWA to form all-female labor unions, but with little success. She accomplished more in her work with the joint campaign by the WWA and \\'\\'The Revolution\\'\\' to win a pardon for [[Hester Vaughn]], a domestic worker who had been found guilty of [[infanticide]] and sentenced to death. Charging that the social and legal systems treated women unfairly, the WWA petitioned, organized a mass meeting at which Anthony was one of the speakers, and sent delegations to visit Vaughn in prison and to speak with the governor. Vaughn was eventually pardoned.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA145 pp. 145–46]</ref>\\n\\nOriginally with a membership that included over a hundred wage-earning women, the WWA evolved into an organization consisting almost entirely of journalists, doctors and other middle-class working women. Its members formed the core of the New York City portion of the new national suffrage organization that Anthony and Stanton were in the process of forming.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA193 pp. 133, 148–51, 161, 193]</ref>\\n\\n===Split in the women\\'s movement===\\nIn May 1869, two days after the final AERA convention, Anthony, Stanton and others formed the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] (NWSA). In November 1869, [[Lucy Stone]], [[Julia Ward Howe]] and others formed the competing [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA).  The hostile nature of their rivalry created a partisan atmosphere that endured for decades, affecting even professional historians of the women\\'s movement.<ref>DuBois (1978), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ilKeKwmjFGUC&pg=PA173 pp. 173, 189, 196].</ref>\\n\\nThe immediate cause for the split was the proposed [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race. In one of her most controversial actions, Anthony opposed the amendment. She and Stanton campaigned against it because they believed that by effectively [[suffrage|enfranchising]] all men while excluding all women, the amendment would create an \"aristocracy of sex\" by giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women. They wanted women and African Americans to be enfranchised at the same time.<ref>Rakow and Kramarae eds. (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ahcmo4_Jko0C&pg=PA47 pp. 47–49]</ref>\\n\\nThe AWSA supported the amendment, but Lucy Stone, who became its most prominent leader, also made it clear that she believed that suffrage for women would be more beneficial to the country than suffrage for black men.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu02stanuoft#page/384/mode/2up p. 384]. Stone is speaking here during the final AERA convention in 1869. Support for the amendment did not necessarily mean that all AWSA members were free from the racial presumptions of that era.  [[Henry Brown Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]], Lucy Stone\\'s husband and a prominent AWSA member, published an open letter to Southern legislatures assuring them that if they allowed both blacks and women to vote, \"the political supremacy of your white race will remain unchanged\" and that \"the black race would gravitate by the law of nature toward the tropics\".

The NWSA was politically independent, but the AWSA at least initially aimed for close ties with the Republican Party, hoping that the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment would lead to a Republican push for women\\'s suffrage.  The NWSA focused primarily on winning suffrage at the national level while the AWSA pursued a state-by-state strategy. The NWSA initially worked on a wider range of women\\'s issues than the AWSA, including divorce reform and [[equal pay for women]].<ref>DuBois (1978), pp. 197-200.  The high point of Republican support was a non-committal reference to women\\'s suffrage in the 1872 Republican platform.</ref>\\n\\nEvents soon removed much of the basis for the split in the women\\'s movement. In 1870, debate about the Fifteenth Amendment was made irrelevant when that amendment was officially ratified. In 1872, disgust with corruption in government led to a mass defection of abolitionists and other social reformers from the Republicans to the short-lived [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]].<ref>DuBois (1978), pp. 166, 200</ref> As early as 1875, Anthony began urging the NWSA to focus more exclusively on women\\'s suffrage rather than a variety of women\\'s issues.<ref>Barry (1988), pp. 264–65</ref> The rivalry between the two women\\'s groups was so bitter, however, that a merger proved to be impossible for twenty years. The AWSA, which was especially strong in [[New England]], was the larger of the two organizations, but it began to decline in strength during the 1880s.<ref>Gordon (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QSWhKqKt1moC&pg=PR25 pp. xxv, 55]</ref>\\nIn 1890, the two organizations merged as the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA), with Stanton as president but with Anthony as its effective leader. When Stanton retired from her post in 1892, Anthony became NAWSA\\'s president.<ref>Barry (1988), pp. 296–99, 303</ref>\\n\\n===National suffrage movement===\\n[[File:Letter by Susan B. Anthony in Support of Women\\'s Suffrage page 1 of 2.jpg|thumb|Letter by Susan B. Anthony to US Congress in favor of Women\\'s Suffrage]]\\n\\n\"By the end of the Civil War,\" according to historian [[Ann D. Gordon]], \"Susan B. Anthony occupied new social and political territory.  She was emerging on the national scene as a female leader, something new in American history, and she did so as a single woman in a culture that perceived the spinster as anomalous and unguarded ... By the 1880s, she was among the senior political figures in the United States.\"<ref>Gordon, Ann D., \"Knowing Susan B. Anthony: The Stories We Tell of a Life\", in Ridarsky, Christine L. and Huth, Mary M., editors (2012). \\'\\'Susan B. Anthony and the Struggle for Equal Rights\\'\\'. Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press. pp. 202, 204; ISBN 978-1-58046-425-3</ref>\\n\\nAfter the formation of the NWSA, Anthony dedicated herself fully to the organization and to women\\'s suffrage.  She did not draw a salary from either it or its successor, the NAWSA, but on the contrary used her lecture fees to fund those organizations.<ref name=\"Sherr 1995, pp. 226–27\">Sherr (1995), pp. 226–27</ref> There was no national office, the mailing address being simply that of one of the officers.<ref>Flexner (1959), p. 241</ref>\\n\\nThat Anthony had remained unmarried gave her an important business advantage in this work. A married woman at that time had the legal status of [[coverture|\\'\\'feme covert\\'\\']], which, among other things, excluded her from signing contracts (her husband could do that for her, if he chose). As Anthony had no husband, she was a [[coverture|\\'\\'feme sole\\'\\']] and could freely sign contracts for convention halls, printed materials, etc.<ref>Barry (1988), pp. 57–58, 259</ref>\\nUsing fees she earned by lecturing, she paid off the debts she had accumulated while supporting \\'\\'The Revolution\\'\\'. With the press treating her as a celebrity, she proved to be a major draw.<ref>Gordon (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=U3diaaiUZjQC&pg=PR21 p. xxi]</ref> Over her career she estimated that she averaged 75 to 100 speeches per year. Travel conditions in the earlier days were sometimes appalling. Once she gave a speech from the top of a billiard table. On another occasion her train was snowbound for days, and she survived on crackers and dried fish.<ref>Sherr (1995), pp. 123–24, 132–33</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Anthony dollar coin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Susan B. Anthony dollar|U.S. dollar coin with image of Susan. B. Anthony]]]]\\nBoth Anthony and Stanton joined the lecture circuit about 1870, usually traveling from mid-autumn to spring. The timing was right because the nation was beginning to discuss women\\'s suffrage as a serious matter.  Occasionally they traveled together but most often not.  Lecture bureaus scheduled their tours and handled the travel arrangements, which generally involved traveling during the day and speaking at night, sometimes for weeks at a time, including weekends. Their lectures brought new recruits into the movement who strengthened suffrage organizations at the local, state and national levels. Their journeys during that decade covered a distance that was unmatched by any other reformer or politician.<ref name=gordon>Ward (1999), \"Taking Possession of the Country\" by Ann D. Gordon, pp. 163–69</ref>\\nAnthony\\'s other suffrage work included organizing national conventions, lobbying Congress and state legislatures, and participating in a seemingly endless series of state suffrage campaigns.\\n\\nA special opportunity arose in 1876 when the U.S. celebrated its 100th birthday as an independent country. The NWSA asked permission to present a Declaration of Rights for Women at the official ceremony in Philadelphia, but was refused. Undaunted, five women, headed by Anthony, walked onto the platform during the ceremony and handed their Declaration to the startled official in charge. As they left, they handed out copies of it to the crowd.   Spotting an unoccupied bandstand outside the hall, Anthony mounted it and read the Declaration to a large crowd. Afterwards she invited everyone to a NWSA convention at the nearby Unitarian church where speakers like [[Lucretia Mott]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] awaited them.<ref>Flexner (1959), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA163 pp. 163–64]</ref><ref>Bacon (1986), pp. 132–33</ref>\\n\\nThe work of all segments of the women\\'s suffrage movement began to show clear results.  Women won the right to vote in Wyoming in 1869 and in Utah in 1870. Her lectures in Washington and four other states led directly to invitations for her to address the state legislatures there.<ref name=gordon/>\\n\\n[[National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|The Grange]], a large advocacy group for farmers, officially supported women\\'s suffrage as early as 1885. The [[Women\\'s Christian Temperance Union]], the largest women\\'s organization in the country, also supported [[suffrage]].<ref>Flexner (1959), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjEw6ZnVm1EC&pg=PA173 pp. 173–74, 210]</ref>\\n\\nAnthony\\'s commitment to the movement, her spartan lifestyle, and the fact that she did not seek personal financial gain, made her an effective fund-raiser and won her the admiration of many who did not agree with her goals.<ref name=\"Sherr 1995, pp. 226–27\"/> As her reputation grew, her working and travel conditions improved.

Responsibility for that federal circuit was in the hands of Justice [[Ward Hunt]], who had recently been appointed to the U.S. [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].

Titled \"Ancient History\", it shows an Anthony-like figure in classical dress leading a protest for women\\'s rights]]\\nAnthony and Stanton initiated the project of writing a history of the women\\'s suffrage movement in 1876. Anthony had for years saved letters, newspapers clippings, and other materials of historical value to the women\\'s movement. In 1876, she moved into the Stanton household in New Jersey along with several trunks and boxes of these materials to begin working with Stanton on the \\'\\'[[History of Woman Suffrage]]\\'\\'.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 1, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa00unkngoog#page/n553/mode/2up p. 480]</ref>\\n\\nAnthony hated this type of work. In her letters, she said the project \"makes me feel growly all the time ... No warhorse ever panted for the rush of battle more than I for outside work.  I love to make history but hate to write it.\"<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa01harpgoog#page/n123/mode/2up p. 602]</ref>\\nThe work absorbed much of her time for several years although she continued to work on other women\\'s suffrage activities. She acted as her own publisher, which presented several problems, including finding space for the inventory. She was forced to limit the number of books she was storing in the attic of her sister\\'s house because the weight was threatening to collapse the structure.<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 3, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa02harpgoog#page/n209/mode/2up p. 1277]</ref>\\n\\nOriginally envisioned as a modest publication that could be produced quickly, the history evolved into a six-volume work of more than 5700 pages written over a period of 41 years.  The first three volumes, which cover the movement up to 1885, were published between 1881 and 1886 and were produced by Stanton, Anthony and [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]]. Anthony handled the production details and the extensive correspondence with contributors. Anthony published Volume 4, which covers the period from 1883 to 1900, in 1902, after Stanton\\'s death, with the help of [[Ida Husted Harper]], Anthony\\'s designated biographer. The last two volumes, which bring the history up to 1920, were completed in 1922 by Harper after Anthony\\'s death.\\n\\nThe History of Woman Suffrage preserves an enormous amount of material that might have been lost forever.  Written by leaders of one wing of the divided women\\'s movement (Lucy Stone, their main rival, refused to have anything to do with the project), it does not, however, give a balanced view of events where their rivals are concerned.   It overstates the role of Anthony and Stanton, and it understates or ignores the roles of Stone and other activists who did not fit into the historical narrative that Anthony and Stanton developed.  Because it was for years the main source of documentation about the suffrage movement, historians have had to uncover other sources to provide a more balanced view.<ref>Cullen-DuPont (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIro7MtiFuYC&pg=PA115 p. 115] \\'\\'History of Woman Suffrage\\'\\'</ref><ref>Tetrault (2014), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYZgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA125 pp. 125–40].

The preparatory work was handled primarily by Anthony and two of her younger colleagues in the NWSA, [[Rachel Foster Avery]] and [[May Wright Sewall]].  Delegates from fifty-three women\\'s organizations in nine countries met in Washington in 1888 to form the new association, which was called the [[International Council of Women]] (ICW). The delegates represented a wide variety of organizations, including suffrage associations, professional groups, literary clubs, temperance unions, labor leagues and missionary societies.  The [[American Woman Suffrage Association]], which had for years been a rival to the NWSA, participated in the congress. Anthony opened the first session of the ICW and presided over most events.<ref>Barry (1988), pp. 283-287</ref>\\n\\nThe ICW commanded respect at the highest levels.  [[Grover Cleveland|President Cleveland]] and his wife sponsored a reception at the [[White House]] for delegates to the ICW\\'s founding congress. The ICW\\'s second congress was an integral part of the [[World\\'s Columbian Exposition]] held in Chicago in 1893.  At its third congress in London in 1899, a reception for the ICW was held at [[Windsor Castle]] at the invitation of [[Queen Victoria]]. At its fourth congress in Berlin in 1904, [[Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein|Augusta Victoria]], the German Empress, received the ICW leaders at her palace. Anthony played a prominent role on all four occasions.<ref>Barry (1988), pp. 287, 328–29, 349.

It hosted several world congresses, each dealing with a specialized topic, such as religion, medicine and science. At almost the last moment, the U.S. Congress decided that the Exposition should also recognize the role of women. After it was over, one of the organizers of the Exposition\\'s congress of women revealed that Anthony had played a pivotal but hidden role in that last-minute decision. Fearing that a public campaign would rouse opposition, Anthony had worked quietly to organize support for this project among women of the political elite.  Anthony increased the pressure by covertly initiating a petition that was signed by wives and daughters of Supreme Court judges, senators, cabinet members and other dignitaries.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 4, [https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu04stanuoft#page/232/mode/2up pp. 232–33].

The existing [[International Council of Women]] could not be expected to support a campaign for women\\'s suffrage because it was a broad alliance whose more conservative members would object. In 1902, Catt organized a preparatory meeting in Washington, with Anthony as chair, that was attended by delegates from several countries. Organized primarily by Catt, the [[International Alliance of Women|International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] was created in Berlin in 1904. The founding meeting was chaired by Anthony, who was declared to be the new organization\\'s honorary president and first member.<ref>Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 6,\\n[https://archive.org/stream/historyofwomansu06stanuoft#page/804/mode/2up pp. 805-11]</ref>\\nAccording to Anthony\\'s authorized biographer, \"no event ever gave Miss Anthony such profound satisfaction as this one\".<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 3,   [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa02harpgoog#page/n265/mode/2up p. 1326]</ref>\\nLater renamed the [[International Alliance of Women]], the organization is still active and is affiliated with the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://womenalliance.org/what-is-iaw|title=What is IAW|publisher=International Alliance of Women|accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref>\\n\\n===Relationship with Stanton===\\n[[File:Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] (sitting) with Anthony]]\\n\\nAnthony and Stanton worked together in a close and productive relationship.  From 1880 to 1886 they were together almost every day working on the \\'\\'[[History of Woman Suffrage]]\\'\\'.<ref name=griffith-182>Griffith (1984), p. 182</ref>\\nThey referred to each other as \"Susan\" and \"Mrs. Stanton\".<ref>Barry (1988), p. 63</ref>\\nAnthony deferred to Stanton in other ways also, not accepting an office in any organization that would place her above Stanton.<ref>Barry (1988), p. 297</ref>\\nIn practice this generally meant that Anthony, although ostensibly holding a less important office, handled most of the organization\\'s daily activities.<ref>Ward (1999), p. 72</ref>\\nStanton sometimes felt the weight of Anthony\\'s determination and drive. When Stanton arrived at an important meeting in 1888 with her speech not yet written, Anthony insisted that Stanton stay in her hotel room until she had written it, and she placed a younger colleague outside her door to make sure she did so.<ref>Barry (1988), p. 286</ref> \\nAt Anthony\\'s 70th birthday celebration, Stanton teased her by saying, \"Well, as all women are supposed to be under the thumb of some man, I prefer a tyrant of my own sex, so I shall not deny the patent fact of my subjection.\"<ref>Gordon (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=QSWhKqKt1moC&pg=PA242 p. 242]</ref>\\n\\nTheir interests began to diverge somewhat as they grew older. As the drive for women\\'s suffrage gained momentum, Anthony began to form alliances with more conservative groups, such as the [[Women\\'s Christian Temperance Union]], the nation\\'s largest women\\'s organization and a supporter of women\\'s suffrage.<ref>Griffith (1984), pp. 182, 194</ref>  \\nSuch moves irritated Stanton, who said, \"I get more radical as I get older, while she seems to grow more conservative.\"<ref>Stanton\\'s diary, January 9, 1889, quoted in Griffith (1984), p. 195</ref> In 1895 Stanton published \\'\\'[[The Woman\\'s Bible]]\\'\\', which attacked the use of the \\'\\'[[Bible]]\\'\\' to relegate women to an inferior status. It became a highly controversial best-seller. The NAWSA voted to disavow any connection with it despite Anthony\\'s strong objection that such a move was unnecessary and hurtful.<ref>Griffith (1984), pp. 210–13</ref> \\nEven so, Anthony refused to assist with the book\\'s preparation, telling Stanton: \"You say \\'women must be emancipated from their superstitions before enfranchisement will have any benefit,\\' and I say just the reverse, that women must be enfranchised before they can be emancipated from their superstitions.\"<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 2, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa01harpgoog#page/n395/mode/2up p. 857]</ref>\\nDespite such friction, their relationship continued to be close. When Stanton died in 1902, Anthony wrote to a friend: \"Oh, this awful hush! It seems impossible that voice is stilled which I have loved to hear for fifty years.  Always I have felt I must have Mrs. Stanton\\'s opinion of things before I knew where I stood myself. I am all at sea...\"<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 3, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa02harpgoog#page/n195/mode/2up p. 1264]</ref>\\n\\n===Later life===\\n[[File:Susan-b-anthony-house.jpg|thumb|left|The house that Susan B.

She played a key role in raising the funds required by the [[University of Rochester]] before they would admit women students, pledging her life insurance policy to close the final funding gap.<ref>[http://www.rochester.lib.ny.us/~rochhist/v7_1945/v7i2.pdf  McKelvey (April 1945)], pp. 22–23</ref>\\n\\nIn 1896, she spent eight months on the California suffrage campaign, speaking as many as three times per day in more than 30 localities. In 1900, she presided over her last NAWSA convention.  During the six remaining years of her life, Anthony spoke at six more NAWSA conventions and four congressional hearings, completed the fourth volume of the \\'\\'History of Woman Suffrage\\'\\', and traveled to eighteen states and to Europe.<ref>Sherr (1995), pp. 320–21, 120</ref> As Anthony\\'s fame grew, some politicians (certainly not all of them) were happy to be publicly associated with her.

When [[Lucy Stone]] abandoned her pledge to stay single, Anthony\\'s scolding remarks caused a temporary rupture in their friendship.<ref>Barry, p. 119</ref> Journalists repeatedly asked Anthony to explain why she never married. She answered one by saying, \"It always happened that the men I wanted were those I could not get, and those who wanted me I wouldn\\'t have.\"<ref>\\'\\'The Woman\\'s Column\\'\\', August 14, 1897, quoted in Sherr, p. 13</ref> To another she answered, \"I never found the man who was necessary to my happiness.

Just think, had I married at twenty, I would have been a drudge or a doll for fifty-nine years.

[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Blackstone\\'s \\'\\'Commentaries\\'\\']], the basis for the legal systems in most states at that time, stated that, \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage\".<ref>Gordon (2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kjq1rbyN_IQC&pg=PA41 p. 41]</ref>\\n\\nIn a speech in 1877, Anthony predicted \"\\'\\'an epoch of single women\\'\\'. If women will not accept marriage \\'\\'with subjugation\\'\\', nor men proffer it \\'\\'without\\'\\', there is, there can be, \\'\\'no alternative\\'\\'.  The woman who \\'\\'will not be ruled\\'\\' must live without marriage.\"<ref>\"Homes of Single Women\" by Susan B. Anthony, 1877, quoted in \\'\\'The Elizabeth Cady Stanton – Susan B.

The full quote refers to Anthony\\'s satisfaction at having helped bring about \"a better state of things for mothers generally, so that their unborn little ones could not be willed away from them.\" The legal system had previously given a dying husband the power to specify in his will who would get custody of \"his\" children, including any not yet born.

At her birthday celebration in [[Washington D.C.]] a few days earlier, Anthony had spoken of those who had worked with her for women\\'s rights: \"There have been others also just as true and devoted to the cause — I wish I could name every one — but with such women consecrating their lives, failure is impossible!\"<ref>Harper (1898–1908), Vol. 3, [https://archive.org/stream/lifeandworksusa02harpgoog#page/n355/mode/2up p. 1409].

At the time of her death, women had achieved suffrage in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and Idaho, and several larger states followed soon after. Legal rights for married women had been established in most states, and most professions had at least a few women members. 36,000 women were attending colleges and universities, up from zero a few decades earlier.\"<ref>Sherr (1995), pp. xxiv–xxv, 310</ref> Two years before she died, Anthony said, \"The world has never witnessed a greater revolution than in the sphere of woman during this fifty years\".<ref>{{cite news|title=none|newspaper=New York Sun|date=February 21, 1904}} Quoted in Sherr (1995), p. xxvi.</ref>\\n\\nPart of the revolution was in ways of thinking. In a speech in 1889, Anthony noted that women had always been taught that their purpose was to serve men, but \"Now, after 40 years of agitation, the idea is beginning to prevail that women were created for themselves, for their own happiness, and for the welfare of the world.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=none|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 31, 1889}} Quoted in Sherr (1995), p. 58.</ref> Anthony was sure that women\\'s suffrage would be achieved, but she also feared that people would forget how difficult it was to achieve it, as they were already forgetting the ordeals of the recent past:{{Quote box|quote=We shall someday be heeded, and when we shall have our amendment to the Constitution of the United States, everybody will think it was always so, just exactly as many young people think that all the privileges, all the freedom, all the enjoyments which woman now possesses always were hers.

Considered to be a German war crime.\\n* In the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] conducted death marches of Allied POWs, including the infamous [[Bataan Death March]] (1942) and [[Sandakan Death Marches]] (1945). The former forcibly transferred 60-80,000 POWs to Balanga, resulting in the deaths of 2,500–10,000 Filipinos and 100–650 Americans, the latter causing the deaths of 2,345 Australians and British, of which only 6 survived. Both the Bataan and Sandakan death marches were judged as war crimes. \\n* The term \"[[Death marches (Holocaust)|death march]]\" was used in the context of the [[World War II]] history by victims and then by historians to refer to the forcible movement between fall 1944 and April 1945 by [[Nazi Germany]] of thousands of prisoners, from [[Nazi concentration camps]] near the advancing war fronts to camps inside Germany.  One infamous death march occurred in January 1945, as the Soviet [[Red Army]] advanced on occupied Poland. Nine days before the Soviets arrived at the death camp at [[Auschwitz]], the [[SS]] marched nearly 60,000 prisoners out of the camp toward [[Wodzisław Śląski]] (German: [[Loslau]]), 35 miles away, where they were put on freight trains to other camps.

The march occurred in the context of North Korea being over-run by United Nations forces. As North Korean forces had retreated to the [[Yalu River]] on the border with China, they had evacuated their prisoners with them. On 31 October 1950, some 845 prisoners, including about eighty noncombatants, left [[Manpo]] and went upriver, arriving on 8 November 1950 at [[Chunggang]]. A year later, fewer than 300 of the prisoners were still alive. The march was named after the brutal North Korean colonel who was in charge, nicknamed \"The Tiger\".

Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1–8 years on [[active duty]] and then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]].\\n\\nConscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including [[conscientious objection]] to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}</ref> and seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in another country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing [[alternative service]] outside [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside the military, such as \\'Siviilipalvelus\\' (alternative civil service) in Finland, [[Zivildienst]] (compulsory community service) in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. Most post-Soviet countries conscript soldiers not only for armed forces but also for paramilitary organizations which are dedicated to [[police]]-like \\'\\'domestic only\\'\\' service ([[Internal Troops]]) or \\'\\'non-[[combat]]\\'\\' [[rescue|rescue duties]] ([[Civil defence|Civil defence troops]]) – none of which is considered alternative to the military conscription.\\n\\nAs of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]] enlisted to meet the demand for troops. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription therefore still reserve the power to resume it during [[war]]time or times of crisis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/second-world-war-wwii/ <!--Bot repaired link--> |title=World War II |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] }}</ref> States involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, whereas democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Asal|first=Victor|last2=Conrad|first2=Justin|last3=Toronto|first3=Nathan|date=2017-08-01|title=I Want You!

Under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land. It is possible that this right was not to hold land \\'\\'per se\\'\\' but specific land supplied by the state.<ref name=JN242>{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=242}}</ref>\\n\\nVarious forms of avoiding military service are recorded. While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service. Another option was to sell Ilkum lands and the commitments along with them. With the exception of a few exempted classes, this was forbidden by the Code of Hammurabi.<ref name=JN243>{{Cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=243}}</ref>\\n\\n====Medieval levies====\\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}\\n\\nUnder the [[feudalism|feudal]] conditions for holding land in the medieval period, most [[peasants]] and [[Serfdom#Freemen|freemen]] were liable to provide one man of suitable age per family for military duty when required by either the king or the local lord. The levies raised in this way fought as infantry under local superiors. Although the exact laws varied greatly depending on the country and the period, generally these levies were only obliged to fight for one to three months. Most were subsistence farmers, and it was in everyone\\'s interest to send the men home for harvest-time.\\n\\nIn medieval [[Scandinavia]] the \\'\\'leiðangr\\'\\' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]), \\'\\'leidang\\'\\' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), \\'\\'leding\\'\\', ([[Danish language|Danish]]), \\'\\'ledung\\'\\' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), \\'\\'lichting\\'\\' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]), \\'\\'expeditio\\'\\' ([[Latin]]) or sometimes \\'\\'leþing\\'\\' ([[English language|Old English]]), was a levy of free farmers conscripted into coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defence of the realm.\\n\\nThe bulk of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon English]] army, called the \\'\\'[[fyrd]]\\'\\', was composed of part-time English soldiers drawn from the landowning minor nobility. These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the \\'\\'fyrd\\'\\' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a \"ridiculous fantasy\":<blockquote>The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or \\'\\'fyrd\\'\\' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.<ref>Sturdy, David \\'\\'Alfred the Great\\'\\' Constable (1995), p. 153</ref></blockquote>\\n\\nMedieval levy in Poland was known as the \\'\\'[[pospolite ruszenie]]\\'\\'.\\n\\n====Military slavery====\\n[[File:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|Ottoman [[Janissary|janissaries]]]]\\n\\nThe system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the creation of the corps of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldiers (\\'\\'[[ghulam]]s\\'\\' or \\'\\'[[mamluk]]s\\'\\') by the [[Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu\\'tasim]] in the 820s and 830s. The Turkish troops soon came to [[Anarchy at Samarra|dominate the government]], establishing a pattern throughout the Islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the [[Mamluks of Egypt]] and the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire]], institutions that survived until the early 19th century.\\n\\nIn the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the \\'\\'[[Kapıkulu]]\\'\\'. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the \\'\\'[[devşirme]]\\'\\' (translated \"gathering\" or \"converting\"). The captive children were forced to convert to [[Islam]]. The Sultans [[Military use of children|had the young boys trained]] over several years. Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan\\'s personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the \\'\\'Kapıkulu\\'\\'. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargalı İbrahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Paşa]], were recruited in this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}</ref> By 1609, the Sultan\\'s \\'\\'Kapıkulu\\'\\' forces increased to about 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}</ref>\\n\\nIn later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps. Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan\\'s system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies. As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeniçeri (Turkish military)|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/janissaries.htm|title=Janissaries – LookLex Encyclopaedia|author=Tore Kjeilen|work=i-cias.com}}</ref>\\n\\nSimilar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts. The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]]. On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250–1517.\\n\\nFrom 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops. They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]]. The Mamluks\\' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land. The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |newspaper=Sunnah Online }}</ref>\\n\\nOn the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers. They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated. In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north. The Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], called  \"the Bloodthirsty\" (1672–1727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]]. He used them to coerce the country into submission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= 1994 }}</ref>\\n\\n===In modern times===\\n[[File:Branka 1863.JPG|thumb|Conscription of Poles to the Russian Army in 1863.]]\\n{{see also|Remplacement}}\\nModern conscription, the massed military enlistment of national citizens, was devised during the [[French Revolution]], to enable the [[French First Republic|Republic]] to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies. Deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act, whose first article stated: \"Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation.\"  It enabled the creation of the \\'\\'[[Grande Armée]]\\'\\', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms,\" which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands. More than 2.6 million men were inducted into the French military in this way between the years 1800 and 1813.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Conscription |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/conscription.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwRJ8b4l?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761561714/conscription.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\\n\\nThe defeat of the [[Prussian Army]] in particular shocked the Prussian establishment, which had believed it was invincible after the victories of [[Frederick the Great]]. The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the \\'\\'[[levée en masse]]\\'\\', the military conscription used by France. The \\'\\'Krümpersystem\\'\\' was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.<ref>Dierk Walter. \\'\\'Preussische Heeresreformen 1807–1870: Militärische Innovation und der Mythos der \"Roonschen Reform\"\\'\\'. 2003, in Citino, p. 130</ref>\\n\\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], the military service time \"owed\" by serfs was 25 years at the beginning of the 19th century.

By 1914 the only substantial armies still completely dependent on voluntary enlistment were those of Britain and the United States. Some colonial powers such as France reserved their conscript armies for home service while maintaining professional units for overseas duties.\\n\\n====World Wars====\\n[[File:Young men registering for military conscription, New York City, June 5, 1917.jpg|thumb|Young men registering for conscription during [[World War I]], New York City, June 5, 1917.]]\\n\\nThe range of eligible ages for conscripting was expanded to meet national demand during the World Wars.\\nIn the United States, the [[Selective Service System]] drafted men for World War I initially in an age range from 21 to 30 but expanded its eligibility in 1918 to an age range of 18 to 45.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/163.html |title=Records of the Selective Service System (World War I) }}; see also [[Selective Service Act of 1917]] and [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]].</ref> In the case of a widespread [[mobilization]] of forces where service includes homefront defense, ages of conscripts may range much higher, with the oldest conscripts serving in roles requiring lesser mobility.

Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident is required by law to register with the [[Selective Service System]] within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration).\\n\\nThe cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]] in anti-draft arguments. The cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this is potentially more costly in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&chapter=195469&layout=html&Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |author=[[Milton Friedman]] |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review}}</ref>\\n\\n==Arguments in favor of conscription==\\n\\n===Political and moral motives===\\n{{Further information|Social contract|Social solidarity|Active citizenship}}\\n[[File:Conscription in Iran 3.jpg|thumb|left|Conscription in [[Iran]]]]\\n\\n[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, feeling it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals.

The non-military service of Åland islands has not been arranged since the introduction of the act, and there are no plans to institute it. The inhabitants of Åland islands can also volunteer for military service on the mainland. As of 1995, women [[History of women in the military#Finland|are permitted]] to serve on a voluntary basis and pursue careers in the military after their initial voluntary military service.\\n\\nThe military service takes place in [[Finnish Defence Forces]] or in the [[Finnish Border Guard]].

In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on July 20, 1974 due to the crisis in [[Cyprus]] (the mobilisation was formally ended on December 18, 2002).\\n\\nThe length of a tour has varied historically, between 12–36 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. Although women are accepted into the Greek army on a voluntary basis, they are not required to enlist, as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.\\n\\nSince 2009, [[Greece]] has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a complete professional army system, the government had promised that the mandatory military service would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. However, this timetable is under reconsideration as of April 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. These were caused by a combination of (a) financial difficulties, which meant that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and (b) widespread [http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_935936_14/08/2005_153317 abuse] of the deferment process, which meant that 66% of the draftees deferred service in 2005. In August 2009, the mandatory service was reduced to 9 months for the Land Army, while has remained to 12 months for the Navy and the Air Force. The number of conscripts affected to the latter two has been greatly reduced, with an aim towards full professionalisation.\\n\\n====Lithuania====\\n{{main article|Conscription in Lithuania}}\\nLithuania abolished its conscription in 2008.<ref>https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/02/24/litauen-aterinfor-allman-varnplikt</ref> In May 2015 the Lithuanian parliament voted to return the conscription and the conscripts started their training in August 2015.<ref>https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/08/25/varnplikten-ar-tillbaka-i-litauen-hard-konkurrens-om-platserna</ref> In practice there is no conscription in Lithuania, since all recruits have been volunteers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/lithuania_publishes_2016_conscription_lists/|title=Lithuania publishes 2016 conscription lists|website=www.baltictimes.com}}</ref>\\n\\n====Netherlands====\\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\\n{{main article|Conscription in the Netherlands}}\\nConscription, which was called \"Service Duty\" ({{lang-nl|dienstplicht}}) in the [[Netherlands]], was first employed in 1810 by French occupying forces. [[Napoleon]]\\'s brother [[Louis Bonaparte]], who was [[King of Holland]] from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.\\n\\nLater on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.\\n\\nIn the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-volunteer force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Since then, the Dutch army is an all-volunteer force. However, to this day, every male and female<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/02/02/kaderwet-dienstplicht-wordt-aangepast-voor-vrouwen|title=Kaderwet dienstplicht wordt aangepast voor vrouwen|first=Ministerie van|last=Defensie|work=rijksoverheid.nl|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which they are told that they have been registered but do not have to present themselves for service.
