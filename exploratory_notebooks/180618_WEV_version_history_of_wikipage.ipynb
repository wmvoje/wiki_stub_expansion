In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object, or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\\n\\n* \\'\\'heads\\'\\': refers to an object locally\\n* \\'\\'remotes\\'\\': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository\\n* \\'\\'stash\\'\\': refers to an object not yet committed\\n* \\'\\'meta\\'\\': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced resp gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]]{{clarify<!--This doesn\\'t make sense.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object, or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\\n\\n* \\'\\'heads\\'\\': refers to an object locally\\n* \\'\\'remotes\\'\\': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository\\n* \\'\\'stash\\'\\': refers to an object not yet committed\\n* \\'\\'meta\\'\\': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced resp gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]]{{clarify<!--This doesn\\'t make sense.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object, or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\\n\\n* \\'\\'heads\\'\\': refers to an object locally\\n* \\'\\'remotes\\'\\': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository\\n* \\'\\'stash\\'\\': refers to an object not yet committed\\n* \\'\\'meta\\'\\': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced resp gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]]{{clarify<!--This doesn\\'t make sense.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object, or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\\n\\n* \\'\\'heads\\'\\': refers to an object locally\\n* \\'\\'remotes\\'\\': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository\\n* \\'\\'stash\\'\\': refers to an object not yet committed\\n* \\'\\'meta\\'\\': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced resp gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]]{{clarify<!--This doesn\\'t make sense.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed. The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object, or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\\n\\n* \\'\\'heads\\'\\': refers to an object locally\\n* \\'\\'remotes\\'\\': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository\\n* \\'\\'stash\\'\\': refers to an object not yet committed\\n* \\'\\'meta\\'\\': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced resp gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]]{{clarify<!--This doesn\\'t make sense.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed. The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object, or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\\n\\n* \\'\\'heads\\'\\': refers to an object locally\\n* \\'\\'remotes\\'\\': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository\\n* \\'\\'stash\\'\\': refers to an object not yet committed\\n* \\'\\'meta\\'\\': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced resp gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]]{{clarify<!--This doesn\\'t make sense.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed. The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object, or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\\n\\n* \\'\\'heads\\'\\': refers to an object locally\\n* \\'\\'remotes\\'\\': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository\\n* \\'\\'stash\\'\\': refers to an object not yet committed\\n* \\'\\'meta\\'\\': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced resp gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]]{{clarify<!--This doesn\\'t make sense.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed. The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object, or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\\n\\n* \\'\\'heads\\'\\': refers to an object locally\\n* \\'\\'remotes\\'\\': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository\\n* \\'\\'stash\\'\\': refers to an object not yet committed\\n* \\'\\'meta\\'\\': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced resp gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]]{{clarify<!--This doesn\\'t make sense.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects.

Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object, or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\\n\\n* \\'\\'heads\\'\\': refers to an object locally\\n* \\'\\'remotes\\'\\': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository\\n* \\'\\'stash\\'\\': refers to an object not yet committed\\n* \\'\\'meta\\'\\': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced resp gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]]{{clarify<!--This doesn\\'t make sense.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User\\'s Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git\\'s script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}, praising Git\\'s scriptability</ref>\\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

(In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches, and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[rsync]] (removed in Git 2.8.0<ref>Git 2.8.0 Release Notes {{cite web |url=https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |title=Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |date=2016-03-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160726233537/https://github.com/git/git/blob/v2.8.0/Documentation/RelNotes/2.8.0.txt |archivedate=26 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of extant CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] and [[svk]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst\\'s Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version control systems, and fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a \\'\\'commit\\'\\' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history. Git addresses the issue by detecting renames while browsing the history of snapshots rather than recording it when making the snapshot.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116473016012824 |title=Re: git and bzr |date=2006-11-28}}, on using <code>git-blame</code> to show code moved between source files</ref> (Briefly, given a file in revision \\'\\'N,\\'\\' a file of the same name in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' is its default ancestor. However, when there is no like-named file in revision \\'\\'Nâ1,\\'\\' Git searches for a file that existed only in revision \\'\\'Nâ1\\'\\' and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\\n\\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n* \\'\\'resolve\\'\\': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\\n* \\'\\'recursive\\'\\': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object, or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\\n\\n* \\'\\'heads\\'\\': refers to an object locally\\n* \\'\\'remotes\\'\\': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository\\n* \\'\\'stash\\'\\': refers to an object not yet committed\\n* \\'\\'meta\\'\\': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced resp gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]]{{clarify<!--This doesn\\'t make sense.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run.

In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[SVK]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history and changes are copied from one such repository to another.

These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User\\'s Manual |date=2007-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of \\'\\'packs\\'\\' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a \\'\\'packfile\\'\\'. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, but do not depend on it for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\\n\\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source code tree.\\n\\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\\n\\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history, or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file.

Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob\\'s name internally is a hash of its content.)\\n* A \\'\\'tree\\'\\' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory\\'s contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle Tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to exactly pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\\n* A \\'\\'commit\\'\\' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a time stamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\\n* A \\'\\'tag\\'\\' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\\n\\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this value for the object\\'s name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\\n\\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into \\'\\'packs\\'\\', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\\n\\nGit servers typically listen on [[TCP and UDP port|TCP port]] 9418.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |title=1.4 Getting Started â Installing Git |publisher=git-scm.com |accessdate=2013-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102192025/http://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html#The-Git-Protocol |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\\n\\n=== References ===\\nEvery object in the Git database which is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command, or automatically.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named \\'\\'.git\\'\\' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git doesn\\'t allow the all-lowercase version of \\'\\'.git\\'\\' to be created manually) with malicious files in the \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user \\'\\'pulls\\'\\' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in \\'\\'.git/hooks\\'\\' may be run, which results in the attacker\\'s commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the \\'\\'.git/config\\'\\' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced on the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390|date= 20 December 2014|accessdate= 22 December 2014|website= |publisher= |last= Pettersen|first= Tim|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/|archivedate= 24 December 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.
